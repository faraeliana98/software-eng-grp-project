The   present   research   work   was   designed   to   evaluate   sago   pith   meal   (SPM)   as  feed   for   rumi-
nants.   A   particle   size   distribution   (Experiment   1)   was   determined   in   SPM   prepared   from
sago  logs   by   use   of  three   different   rasping   sizes   (large,   medium   and   small).   The   large   rasping
produced   a  negligible   amount   of   ﬁne   particles   and   a  large   amount   of   large   particles,   while
small  rasping   produced   a  negligible   amount   of   large   particles   and   a  smaller   amount   of  ﬁne
particles  than   the   medium   rasping.   Since   both   large   and   ﬁne   particles   are   not   desirable,   the
SPM   produced   by   the   small   rasping   was   considered   the   best   as  feed   for   ruminants   and  was
used  in   two   experiments   with   sheep   (Experiments   2  and   3)   to  determine   the   digestibility
and   growth   performance/carcass   quality,   respectively.   Sheep   were   divided   in   each   experi-
ment   into   three   treatments   and   each   group   was   fed  one   of   three   SPM   based   diets:   (1)   control
diet  (CNT)   contained   SPM   and   soybean   meal,   (2)   USM   diet   contained   SPM,   soybean   meal
and  urea,   while   (3)   UFM   diet   contained   SPM,   ﬁsh   meal   and   urea.   In   the   Experiment   2,   the
digestibility   of  dry   matter   was   not   different   (P>0.05)   among   the  diets,   but   the   digestibil-
ity  of   neutral   detergent   ﬁber   was   lower   (P<0.05)   for   the   USM   and   UFM   diets   than   for   the
CNT  diet.   However,   there   was   no   difference   (P>0.05)   between   the   USM   and  UFM   diets.   In
Experiment   3,   the   means   for   the   average   daily   gain,   feed   intake,   carcass   weight,   dressing
percentage   and   lean   meat   were   not   different   (P>0.05)   between   the   USM   and   UFM   diets,
but  all   were   higher   (P<0.05)   for   the   CNT   diet   than   for   both   the   USM   and   UFM   diets.   It  was
concluded   that   the  small   rasping   is   best   for   preparation   of   SPM   as  feed   for   ruminants,   and
that  a  highly   soluble   and   rumen   degradable   protein   supplement   is  more   efﬁcient   than   urea
to  support   the   maximum   microbial   growth   in   the   rumen   of   sheep   fed   diets   based   on  SPM
supplemented   with   soybean   meal   or   ﬁsh   meal.

Introduction

Sago  belongs  to  a  group  of  starch-bearing  palms  found  in  the  Malay  Archipelago  that  stretches  from  the  Philippines  to
Papua  New  Guinea.  The  most  common  and  productive  species  that  is  grown  in  the  Borneo  part  of  Malaysia,  mainly  Sarawak,
is  Metroxylon  sagu.  It  is  used  commercially  for  production  of  starch.  However,  there  is  abundance  of  sago  in  Malaysia  and

dried  rasped  sago  pith  has  been  used  for  feeding  animals  since  1873  (Burkhill,  1966).  Together  with  sago  ﬂour,  the  whole
sago  pith  meal  (SPM)  may   be  grouped  into  an  energy  feed  based  on  an  international  classiﬁcation  standard  (Harris  et  al.,
1968).  The  use  of  feed  sources  containing  highly  fermentable  carbohydrate  such  as  SPM  is  important  in  optimizing  livestock
production  in  Malaysia  as  the  lack  of  energy  in  commonly  available  feeds  is  more  critical  than  the  lack  of  other  nutrients.
Several  studies  have  been  conducted  on  the  use  of  SPM  in  diets  of  pigs  and  poultry,  but  very  few  with  feeding  SPM  to
ruminants.  The  ensiled  sago  ﬁber  with  molasses  and  urea  resulted  in  poor  growth  in  lambs  (Yardav  and  Mahyuddin,  1991),
but  when  supplemented  with  corn  grain  and  ﬁsh  meal  the  growth  of  lambs  was  greatly  improved  (Yardav  et  al.,  1991).
There  is  no  recent  information  on  feeding  SPM  to  sheep,  especially  the  type  of  dietary  protein  supplement  such  as  rumen
degradable  protein  (RDP),  rumen  undegradable  protein  (RUP)  and/or  non-protein  N  (NPN)  required  to  obtain  a  reasonable
growth,  feed  utilization  and  carcass  quality  in  sheep.  Also,  there  are  numerous  commercial  factories  in  Malaysia  that  produce
SPM  from  sago  logs  using  different  sizes  of  rasping,  which  can  produce  different  rasping  sizes  of  SPM.  The  feed  particle  size
dynamics  affects  the  nutritive  value  of  feeds  (Murphy  and  Kennedy,  1993);  the  relatively  large  particles  affect  the  normal
passage  from  the  rumen  (Faichney  and  Brown,  1991),  while  ﬁne  particles  formed  lumps  in  the  stomach  resulting  in  lower
digestion  in  the  intestinal  tract  of  pigs  (Ivan  and  Farrell,  1976)  and  grinding  too  ﬁnely  corn  grain  had  negative  effect  on
gain  and  feed  conversion  efﬁciency  in  feedlot  cattle  (Corona  et  al.,  2005).  Therefore,  it  was  hypothesized  that  different  sizes
of  rasping  may   produce  different  distribution  of  sizes  of  particles  and,  therefore,  not  all  rasping  sizes  may   be  suitable  to
produce  SPM  for  use  in  diets  of  ruminants.  Consequently,  the  ﬁrst  objective  of  the  present  study  was  to  test  the  hypothesis
by  the  determination  of  the  particle  size  distribution  and  chemical  composition  from  use  of  different  rasping  sizes  to  prepare
SPM  from  sago  logs  by  a  factory  in  Sarawak;  a  rasping  size  that  produced  the  largest  proportion  of  desirable  medium  and
small  size  particles  and  smallest  proportion  of  undesirable  large  and  ﬁne  size  particles  in  SPM  was   then  selected.  The  second
objective  was  to  use  the  selected  rasping  size  SPM  as  dietary  base  in  combination  with  supplements  of  soybean  meal  (SBM)
as  RDP,  ﬁsh  meal  (FM)  as  RUP  and  urea  as  NPN  to  assess  the  potential  of  SPM  based  diets  in  terms  of  the  digestibility,  growth
performance  and  carcass  quality  in  sheep.

2.1.  Particle  size  distribution—Experiment  1

Three  routinely  used  rasping  sizes  (large,  medium  and  small)  were  used  to  prepare  SPM  from  split  sago  logs  by  a  com-
mercial  factory  in  Sarawak,  Malaysia.  One  batch  of  each  large  and  medium  rasping  and  two   batches  of  small  rasping  were
prepared  and  used  in  the  present  Experiment  1  to  determine  the  particle  size  distribution.  Approximately  130  g  sample  from
each  batch  was  each  placed  on  the  top  of  a  series  of  11  sieve  pens  ﬁxed  on  a  particle  test-sieve  shaker  (Endecotts  Model
EFL2  mk3,  Chelmsford,  Essex,  UK).  The  pen  with  the  largest  mesh  openings  was   placed  on  the  top,  followed  down  with  the
decreasing  mesh  openings,  with  a  collection  pen  on  the  bottom.  There  were  two   different  mesh  size  sieves  for  the  large  mesh
sieve  group  and  three  for  each  medium,  small  and  ﬁne  mesh  sieve  group  (Table  1).  Seven  larger  mesh  size  sieve  pens  were

manufactured  by  the  N.V.  Metaagaas,  Hangelo,  Holland,  while  the  remaining  smaller  size  mesh  sieve  pens  were  supplied
by  the  Endecotts,  Chelmsford,  Essex,  UK.  Each  sample  was  shaken  for  5  min.  The  particles  retained  on  each  sieve  and  on  the
bottom  collection  pen  were  weighed.  The  weights  on  the  sieves  assigned  to  large,  medium,  small  and  ﬁne  mesh  groups  were
combined  and  their  percentage  of  the  sample  weight  was  calculated.  The  chemical  composition  was   determined  for  each
rasping  (Table  1),  while  the  mineral  composition  was  determined  only  for  the  small  rasping  (Table  2).

2.2.  Housing  (Experiment  2  and  3)

Sheep  used  in  the  two  experiments  were  housed  in  individual  pens  with  automatic  drinking  nipples  and  slatted  ﬂoor
in  an  open  wooden  sheep  barn  raised  above  the  ground.  All  sheep  were  drenched  with  Systamex  (Welcome  Foundation
Ltd.,  London,  UK)  to  control  internal  parasites.  The  care  of  the  experimental  animals  was  in  accordance  with  the  country
standards  (including  halal  slaughter)  and  the  experimental  protocol  was   reviewed  by  the  Institutional  Animal  Care  and  Use
Committee.

2.3.  Diets  (Experiment  2  and  3)

Three  experimental  total  mixed  diets  were  prepared  using  the  small  rasping  SPM  (determined  in  Experiment  1  to  be  the
most  appropriate  for  feeding  ruminants  as  discussed  bellow),  and  three  sources  of  the  dietary  N;  SBM  as  RDP,  FM  as  RUP
and  urea  as  soluble  NPN  (Table  3).  The  diets  were  (1)  CTN-control  diet  containing  SPM  and  SBM,  (2)  USM  diet  containing
SPM,  SBM  and  urea,  and  (3)  UFM  diet  containing  SPM,  FM  and  urea.

In  the  control  diet  (CNT)  SBM  provided  most  of  the  dietary  crude  protein  (CP),  while  in  the  other  two   diets  majority  of
the  CP  was  as  NPN  in  the  form  of  urea  and  SPM  and  the  rest  of  CP  was  either  SBM  (diet  USM)  or  FM  (diet  UFM).  All  three  diets
were  approximately  isonitrogenous  (2.7  to  2.8  g  N/kg  dry  matter  (DM))  and  isocaloric  (16  to  17  MJ   gross  energy/kg  DM).
Ammonium  sulfate  provided  required  dietary  sulfur,  while  the  vitamin–mineral  premix  (Vifosmin  2,  Lazuli  Sdn.  Bhd.,  Kuala
Lumpur,  Malaysia)  provided  required  dietary  vitamins  and  minerals.  The  total  mixed  diets  were  prepared  at  approximately
2-weekly  intervals  and  a  small  amount  was  taken  from  each  mixed  diet  as  a  sample.

2.4.  Digestibility—Experiment  2

Nine  one-year  old  male  sheep  were  shorn  and  randomly  assigned  to  three  treatment  groups  in  a  Latin  square  experiment
with  three  diets  (Table  3)  and  three  periods  replicated  over  three  squares.  Over  30  days  prior  to  the  start  of  the  experiment
the  sheep  were  fed  a  sheep  commercial  diet  (based  on  rice  bran  and  SBM)  and  occasionally  placed  into  metabolism  crates
for  training.  All  sheep  were  weighed  before  the  start  of  the  experiment.  The  experiment  consisted  of  three  test  periods,  each
of  two  weeks  adaptation  and  5  days  collection  of  feces.  Dietary  rations  were  weighed  and  fed  twice  daily  in  equal  portions
at  08:30  and  16:30.  Before  feeding,  all  rations  were  mixed  with  15%  water  by  weight  to  prevent  waste  and  dustiness.  During
the  adaptation  the  amount  of  feed  offered  to  individual  sheep  was  adjusted  to  minimize  refusals.  The  total  fecal  output  was
collected,  weighed  and  sampled  (10%)  daily  before  the  morning  feeding.  The  feed  intakes  and  refusals  were  recorded  and
−20 ◦C
sampled  (10%)  daily.  Samples  of  feces,  feed  and  refusals  were  accumulated  in  plastic  bags.  All  samples  were  stored  at 
for  chemical  analysis.

2.5.  Growth  performance  and  carcass  quality—Experiment  3

Twenty  one  approximately  four  months  old  male  sheep  were  used  in  a  feeding  experiment  lasting  91  days.  The  sheep
were  weighed  and  blocked  into  seven  groups  of  three  animals  each  in  descending  order  of  their  initial  weights.  The  sheep
in  each  group  were  then  randomly  assigned  to  three  dietary  treatments  based  on  a  randomized  block  design  (Cox,  1980)
and  fed  the  diet  CNT,  USM  or  UFM  ad  libitum  in  excess  (10%)  of  individual  intakes.  Feed  refusals  were  collected  weighed
and  sampled  each  morning  before  feeding.  Individual  feed  intakes  were  recorded  daily.  The  sheep  were  allowed  to  adapt
to  the  assigned  experimental  diet  for  two  weeks  prior  to  the  start  of  the  91-day  experiment.  Thereafter  they  were  sheared
and  weighed  on  two  consecutive  days  after  feed  and  water  was  withdrawn  for  overnight.  The  same  shearing  and  weighing
procedure  was  used  at  the  end  of  the  experiment.  The  average  of  the  two   consecutive  weighing  was  considered  as  the  initial
or  ﬁnal  live  body  weight.  The  sheep  were  also  weighed  monthly  during  the  experiment.

After  the  end  of  the  feeding  experiment  two  heaviest  sheep  from  each  treatment  were  starved  for  24  h,  weighed  and
slaughtered  (halal  method).  This  procedure  was  repeated  every  2  days  until  all  lambs  were  slaughtered.  Dead  weights  were
recorded  immediately  after  slaughter.  Thereafter  they  were  skinned,  eviscerated  and  the  heads  and  shanks  removed.  Each
carcass  was  split  into  halves  through  the  middle  of  the  spine  by  an  electric  saw.  The  warm  carcass  weight  was   taken  as  the
sum  of  the  two  halves,  while  the  chilled  carcass  weight  was   the  weight  of  the  two   halves  after  24  h  chilling  at  4 ◦C.  Other
measurements  made  on  the  chilled  carcass  include  the  kidney  fat,  channel  fat  and  the  back  fat  thickness.  The  thickness  was
measured  at  the  12th  rib  incision  of  the  left  carcass  side.  The  left  side  of  the  chilled  carcass  was   manually  separated  into  lean
meat,  bones,  and  subcutaneous  and  intramuscular  fats  (separable  fats).  The  weights  of  these  components  were  multiplied
by  two  to  obtain  their  estimated  total  weights  in  the  whole  carcass  and  to  calculate  the  meat:bone  ratio.  The  calculations
were  as  follows:

For  the  right  half  of  each  carcass,  about  3  cm  slice  of  rib  chop  was   taken  as  sample  between  the  10th  and  12th  rib,  wrapped

in  aluminum  foil  to  prevent  formation  of  ice  crystals,  sealed  in  plastic  bags  and  stored  at  −20 ◦C  for  analysis.

2.6.  Chemical  analysis

All  samples  of  SPM,  diets,  refusals  and  feces  were  dried  in  an  oven  at  60 ◦C  for  48  h  and  ground  to  pass  1  mm   screen  in  a
Wiley  Mill  (Model  4;  Thomas  Scientiﬁc,  Swedesboro,  NJ,  USA).  Analytical  DM  was  determined  by  overnight  drying  at  103 ◦C.
The  samples  were  stored  in  air  tight  glass  containers.

Concentrations  of  ash  and  organic  matter  (OM)  (method  no.  7.009),  and  ether  extract  (EE)  (method  no.  13.033)  were
determined  according  to  AOAC  (1984).   The  determination  of  ﬁber  fractions,  neutral  detergent  ﬁber  (aNDFom)  and  acid
detergent  ﬁber  (ADFom),  without  sodium  sulﬁde  and  expressed  free  of  ash  was  based  on  the  procedure  of  Van  Soest  et  al.
(1991).  However,  it  was  noted  that  aNDFom  extraction  from  SPM  using  normal  strength  aNDFom  solution  did  not  dissolve
all  the  starch  present,  which  caused  difﬁculty  in  ﬁltration.  Therefore,  the  samples  were  pre-digested  by  incubation  at  38 ◦C
overnight  in  amylase  (EC  3.2.1.1,  Type  I-A;  Sigma,  St  Luis,  USA)  solution  (1  ml   enzyme  suspension  in  1  L  of  distilled  water
containing  3.56  g  KH2PO4 and  7.22  g  Na2HPO4 at  pH  7.0).  This  was  followed  by  digestion  in  a  more  concentrated  aNDFom
solution  (Close  and  Menke,  1986).  Determination  of  ADFom  was   similar  to  that  for  aNDFom;  the  ADFom  digestion  solu-
tion  contained  11  N  H2SO4 and  20  g  acetylthrimethylammonium  bromide.  The  lignin  with  ash  residue  left  after  ADFom
procedure  was  ashed  in  a  mufﬂe  furnace  at  550 ◦C  for  4  h  to  determine  the  concentration  of  acid  insoluble  ash  (AIA).  The
concentration  of  the  acid  detergent  lignin  (ADL)  was   then  calculated  by  subtracting  AIA  from  the  lignin  with  ash  residue,
while  the  concentration  of  cellulose  was  determined  by  subtracting  the  concentrations  of  hemicelluloses,  ADL  and  AIA  from
the  concentration  of  aNDFom.  All  the  above  procedures  were  sequential  on  the  same  samples.  The  starch  concentration  in

SPM  samples  was  determined  according  to  previously  reported  procedures  (Woods  and  Aurand,  1976;  Aurand  et  al.,  1987).
Crude  protein  was  determined  by  micro-Kjeldahl  procedure,  while  bomb  calorimetry  (Adiabatic  Oxygen  Bomb  Calorimeter,
Par  Instrument  Co.,  Moline,  IL,  USA)  was  used  to  determine  gross  energy.

For  determination  of  mineral  elements  the  SPM  samples  were  digested  in  a  solution  comprising  of  12  ml   65%  HNO3,  12  ml
70%  HClO4 and  1  ml   98%  H2SO4.  After  appropriate  dilution  with  deionized  water  the  concentrations  of  Ca,  Na,  K,  Fe,  Cu,  Co,
Mn,   Zn  and  Cd  were  determined  using  atomic  absorption  spectrophotometer  (Shimadzu  model  AA-680,  Kyoto,  Japan).  The
concentration  of  phosphorus  was  determined  colorimetrically  using  autoanalyzer  (Technicon  Instrument  Co.,  Tarryton,  NY,
USA).

The  rib  chop  samples  were  defrosted  and  prepared  for  EE  based  on  the  method  no  13.033  of  AOAC  (1984).   The  meat  was
separated  from  the  vertebral  bone  and  minced  in  a  blender.  About  3  g  of  the  meat  was   transferred  in  a  previously  tarred
and  dried  cellulose  extraction  thimble  containing  a  small  portion  of  puriﬁed  sand  and  glass  rod.  The  sample  was   thoroughly
mixed  with  the  sand  in  the  thimble  by  using  the  glass  road,  placed  in  a  50  ml   beaker  for  drying  at  125 ◦C  for  1.5  h.  Thereafter,
crude  lipids  were  extracted  with  ether  in  a  Soxhlet  apparatus  (Narang  Medical  Limited,  New  Delhi,  India).

Results

3.1.  Particle  size  distribution  and  chemical  composition

The  large  rasping  of  split  sago  logs  produced  the  largest  percentage  (62.3)  of  large  size  and  smallest  percentage  (0.9)  of
ﬁne  size  SPM  particles  (Table  1).  The  medium  and  small  rasping  produced  very  little  of  the  large  particles,  but  although  the
percentages  of  the  medium  and  small  particle  sizes  were  similar,  the  small  rasping  produced  a  3-fold  less  of  the  ﬁne  particles
than  the  medium  rasping.  The  chemical  composition  of  the  large,  medium  and  small  rasping  SPM  samples  was  similar.  The
concentration  of  starch  in  SPM  showed  the  highest  values  (722–751  g/kg  DM),  followed  by  aNDFom  (126–135  g/kg  DM).

3.2.  Digestibility

The  apparent  DM  digestibility  (Table  4)  of  the  three  experimental  diets  based  on  SPM  (CNT,  USM  and  UFM)  was   similar
(P>0.05).  However  the  digestibility  of  OM  was  higher  (P<0.05)  for  the  UFM  diet  than  for  the  USM  diet,  but  there  was  no  dif-
ference  between  the  CNT  diet  and  the  USM  diet  (P>0.05).  There  were  differences  (P<0.05)  among  the  diets  in  the  digestibility
of  CP,  which  ranked  UFM  >  USM  >  CNT.  The  digestibility  of  aNDFom  was  not  different  (P>0.05)  between  the  diets  USM  and
UFM,  but  it  was  higher  (P<0.05)  for  the  diet  CNT  than  for  the  other  diets  (USM  and  UFM).  The  digestibility  of  EE  was   lower
(P<0.05)  for  the  diet  USM  than  for  the  diets  CNT  and  UFM,  while  there  was   no  difference  (P>0.05)  between  the  diets  CNT
and  UFM.

3.3.  Growth  performance

The  average  initial  body  weight  of  sheep  was   not  different  (P>0.05)  among  the  dietary  treatments  (Table  5).  However,  the
average  ﬁnal  body  weight,  total  weight  gain,  daily  gain  and  daily  feed  intake  were  all  higher  (P<0.05)  for  the  diet  CNT  than  for
the  diets  USM  and  UFM.  There  was  no  difference  (P>0.05)  between  the  diet  USM  and  UFM  in  the  average  ﬁnal  body  weight,
but  the  total  weight  gain  and  average  daily  gain  were  higher  (P<0.05)  for  the  diet  UFM  than  for  the  diet  USM.  However,  the
feed  conversion  ratio  was  higher  (P<0.05)  for  the  diet  USM  than  for  the  diet  CNT,  but  there  were  no  differences  (P>0.05)
between  the  diets  CNT  and  UFM  and  between  the  diets  USM  and  UFM.

3.4.  Carcass  composition

There  were  no  differences  (P>0.05)  among  the  experimental  diets  in  the  separable  fat,  meat:bone  ratio  and  back  fat
(Table  6).  There  were  though  differences  (P<0.05)  in  the  starved  live  weight  among  the  diets,  which  ranked  CNT  >  UFM  >  USM.
However,  the  hot  carcass  weight,  chilled  carcass  weight,  dressing  percentage  and  lean  meat  were  higher  (P<0.05)  for
the  diet  CNT  than  for  the  diets  USM  and  UFM,  but  there  were  no  differences  (P>0.05)  between  the  diets  USM  and
UFM.  The  renal–pelvic  fat  was  higher  (P<0.05)  for  the  diet  CNT  than  for  the  diet  USM,  but  there  were  no  differences
(P>0.05)  between  the  diets  CNT  and  UFM  and  between  the  diets  USM  and  UFM.  The  deboned  rib  cut  EE  was  lower
(P<0.05)  for  the  diet  USM  than  for  the  diets  CNT  and  UFM,  but  there  were  no  differences  between  the  diets  CNT  and
UFM.

The  results  on  the  SPM  particle  size  distribution  from  different  rasping  sizes  clearly  showed  that  for  ruminant  feeding  the
use  of  the  small  rasping  of  sago  logs  produced  the  best  type  of  SPM.  This  is  because  the  small  rasping  produced  a  negligible
amount  of  large  particles  and  lower  amount  of  ﬁne  particles  in  comparison  with  the  medium  rasping.  Although  the  large
rasping  also  produced  a  negligible  amount  of  ﬁne  particles  it  also  produced  a  very  large  amount  (62%)  of  large  size  particles
that  affect  normal  passage  from  the  rumen  (Faichney  and  Brown,  1991).  Reduced  size  of  corn  grain  increased  daily  gains
(Galyean  et  al.,  1979;  Turgeon  et  al.,  1983)  and  starch  digestibility  (Ouellet  et  al.,  2010)  in  ﬁnishing  steers.  On  the  other  hand,
ﬁne  size  particles  were  found  to  produce  lumps  in  the  stomach  of  pigs,  which  did  not  permit  good  penetration  and  mixing
with  digestive  substances,  resulting  in  a  lower  digestibility  of  the  diet  (Ivan  and  Farrell,  1976).  Also,  too  ﬁne  grinding  of  corn
grain  had  negative  effects  on  daily  gains  and  feed  conversion  efﬁciency  in  ﬁnishing  steers  (Corona  et  al.,  2005).  Clearly,  the
feed  particle  size  dynamics  affects  the  nutritive  value  of  feeds  in  ruminants  (Murphy  and  Kennedy,  1993)  and  the  size  of
rasping  did  not  appreciably  affect  the  chemical  composition  of  SPM  in  the  present  study  (Experiment  1).  Therefore  the  small
rasping  preparation  of  SPM  appears  to  be  the  most  suitable  as  ruminant  feed  and  was   selected  for  the  follow-up  experimental
work  with  sheep  in  the  present  study  (Experiments  2  and  3).

The  CNT  diet  comprised  of  approximately  two  thirds  SPM  and  one  third  SBM,  and  resulted  in  a  reasonably  good  growth
performance  (gain,  feed  intake  and  feed:gain  ratio)  of  sheep.  However,  when  approximately  76%  of  the  SBM  portion  in  the
CNT  diet  was  replaced  by  an  equivalent  amount  of  N  in  the  form  of  NPN  (urea;  diet  USM)  and  increased  amount  of  SPM  the
growth  performance  of  sheep  decreased.  This  was  in  spite  of  approximately  the  same  apparent  digestibility  of  DM  and  OM
in  the  two  diets.  It  is  though  interesting  to  note  that  the  digestibility  of  aNDFom  and  the  feed  intake  of  lambs  fed  the  USM
diet  decreased.  Although  the  feed  palatability  might  have  been  negatively  affected  somewhat  by  the  extra  dietary  SPM  and
the  urea  supplement,  the  lower  digestibility  of  aNDFom  was  most  probably  responsible  for  the  lower  feed  intake.  This  is  in
agreement  with  the  suggestion  of  Leng  (1990)  that  the  voluntary  feed  intake  may   be  stimulated  by  higher  digestibility.  This
would  indicate  that  the  rumen  microbial  activity  was  negatively  affected  by  the  increased  dietary  SPM  and  urea  supplement,
resulting  in  the  lower  digestibility  of  aNDFom  and  increased  rumen  ﬁll  in  the  present  experiment.  A  lower  feed  intake  and
growth  of  goats  was  reported  when  SPM  replaced  60%  of  a  commercial  concentrate  diet  (Tuen,  1994).  However  the  dietary
SPM  had  a  positive  effect  on  the  nutrient  utilization,  while  the  growth  performance  and  digestibility  was   not  affected  when
SPM  replaced  corn  grain  in  the  diet  of  cattle  (Chanjula  and  Ngampongsai,  2009;  Ngampongsai  and  Chanjula,  2009).

The  replacement  of  SBM  in  the  diet  USM  with  FM  (diet  UFM  vs  diet  USM)  resulted  in  only  a  small  improvement  in  the
growth  performance  of  sheep.  In  addition  to  poorer  growth  performance  and  digestibility  there  was  also  indication  for
poorer  carcass  composition  in  sheep  fed  urea  in  combination  with  SBM  or  FM  (diets  USM  and  UFM  vs  diet  CNT).  This  was
especially  so  in  the  case  of  dressing  percentage  and  lean  meat  yield.  It  therefore  appears  that  although  the  level  of  N  in  the
form  of  ammonia  available  to  rumen  bacteria  might  have  been  adequate  for  all  three  diets,  there  was  probably  shortage  of
available  amino  acid/peptide  N  for  maximal  growth  of  bacteria  in  sheep  fed  the  diets  USM  and  UFM.  In  addition,  SPM  contains
high  percentage  of  rumen  fermentable  starch  that  would  contribute  to  higher  rate  of  energy  release  in  the  rumen.  A  greater
amount  of  available  energy  in  the  rumen  leads  to  a  requirement  for  more  RDP  (Cooper  at  al.,  2002).  Rooke  and  Armstrong
(1989)  drew  attention  to  the  importance  of  a  supply  of  RDP,  such  as  casein,  rather  than  NPN,  such  as  urea,  in  stimulating
rumen  microbial  N  synthesis.  Indeed  Satter  and  Armstrong  (1975)  pointed  out  that  dietary  urea  is  rapidly  hydrolyzed  in  the
rumen,  but  rumen  carbohydrate  degradation  and  microbial  growth  is  slower  process  than  the  releasing  of  ammonia  N,  thus,
urea  is  inefﬁciently  used  by  microorganisms.  Also,  it  was  reported  (Chen  et  al.,  1987)  that  rumen  bacteria  have  a  preference
for  peptide  N,  which  might  be  supplied  by  RDP.  A  sufﬁcient  amount  of  RDP  must  be  present  in  the  diet  to  support  maximum
bacterial  growth  yield  and  fermentation  in  the  rumen  (Ivan  et  al.,  1996).  It  is  apparent  that  the  supplements  of  urea  with  SBM
or  FM  have  not  fulﬁlled  this  requirement  in  the  present  experiment.  Additional  research  is  conducted  in  this  laboratory  to
gain  more  information  on  the  effects  of  the  present  SPM  based  diets  on  rumen  fermentation,  microbial  synthesis  of  protein
and  duodenal  ﬂow  of  the  dietary  components.

Conclusion

A  properly  prepared  SPM  appears  to  be  acceptable  source  of  the  dietary  energy  for  ruminants  and  the  small  rasping  size
is  most  appropriate  for  its  preparation  from  the  sago  logs.  Such  preparation  results  in  good  distribution  of  sizes  of  particles,
without  excessive  amounts  of  large  and  ﬁne  particles  that  negatively  affect  digestion  of  the  diet  by  ruminants.
