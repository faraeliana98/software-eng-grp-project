Abstract
Magnesium  deficiencies  have  been  shown  to  be  particularly  dangerous  to  short  cycled  crops, both  on  sandy  and
clay  soils. Such  deficiencies  may  be  corrected  by  foliar  fertilisations, but  in  French  bean  (Phaseolus  vulgaris L.)  no
experimental  data  may  be  found  to  support  this  hypothesis. Therefore  this  paper  was  aimed  at  studying  the  effect
of  foliar  Mg-applications  (56, 112  and  224  g  ha-1 in  single  application  at  flowering  or  splitted  half  dose  at  4-leaf
stage  and  half  at  flowering)  alone  and  with  Zn  (200  g  ha-1)  on  yield  and  quality  of  two  French  bean  genotypes
(Bronco, Cadillac).
Foliar  Mg-applications  significantly  increased  pod  yield  and, considering  the  highest  rate  with  respect  to  the  un-
treated, such an increase was 78% and 32% for Bronco and Cadillac, respectively. Split applications were also more
effective, with  yield  increases  of  109%  and  50%  for  the  two  genotypes. Concerning  quality, foliar  Mg  applications
showed  a  significant  effect  particularly  on  sugars, calcium, phosphate, sulphate  and  Mg  contents  in  pods. On  the
other  hand, a  significant  effect  on  the  accumulation  of  nitrates  was  noted, especially  with  split  applications  (144%
increase  vs. unfertilised)  and, in  some  cases, an  antagonistic  effect  on  K  content  (10-20%  decrease  on  average).
Foliar  Mg  fertilisation  of  French  bean  seemed  to  be  a  promising  practice  with  reference  to  human  health  and  nu-
trition, tough  some  care  is  needed  to  avoid  the  accumulation  of  nitrates  in  pods. Split  applications  seemed  to  be
more  effective, while  the  addition  of  Zn  to  the  fertiliser  mix  did  not  give  any  relevant  effect.

Key-words: fertilisation, fruit  quality, microelements, magnesium, French  bean.

1. Introduction

Magnesium plays an important role in plant me-
tabolism and physiology, as it is a component of
the  chlorophyll  molecule  and  it  is  required  for
normal  structural  development  of  chloroplasts
and  other  organelles  such  as  the  mitochondria,
where  it  is  the  bridging  element  for  ribosome
aggregation  (Shaull, 2002). Magnesium  also  ac-
tivates  or  regulates  several  kinases, ATPases,
RUBP  carboxylase/oxygenase  and  many  other
enzymes of carbohydrate metabolism (Marschner,
1995).

Mg  deficiency  is  likely  to  decrease  the  effi-
ciency  of  the  Calvin  cycle, reduces  the  utiliza-
tion  of  reductive  power  (NADPH)  and  causes

an  over-saturation  of  the  photosynthetic  elec-
tron transport system. Enhanced activity of an-
tioxidative  enzymes  and  higher  concentrations
of antioxidant molecules have been reported in
Mg  deficient  beans  (Phaseolus  vulgaris  L.)
(Cakmak, 1994), Mentha (Candan and Tarhan,
2003)  and  maize  (Zea  mays L.)  plants  (Tewari
et  al., 2004). Furthermore, Mg-deficient  leaves
can be highly photosensitive and respond to in-
creased light intensity with severe chlorosis and
photooxidation of thylakoid constituents, due to
generation of reactive oxygen species (Cakmak
and Marschner, 1992). At the crop level, this can
cause  depressed  plant  growth  and  yield.

Magnesium  deficiency  is  a  major  problem,
particularly in Italy, where soils have a low plant

available  Mg. This  can  happen  in  sandy  soils,
which  have  a  low  pH  and  cation  exchange  ca-
pacity, and  in  clays, due  to  a  high  K  content,
which is antagonistic to Mg uptake (Alpi et al.,
2000). Moreover, increased  use  of  concentrated
mineral fertilisers and decreased use of organic
fertilisers  have  led  to  a  deterioration  of  soil
chemical fertility with lower macro- and micro-
element  availability.

French  bean  (Phaseolus  vulgaris L.)  is  one
of  the  most  popular  vegetables  in  Europe.
Among  other  factors  such  as  geographic  loca-
tion, cultivar  choice, time  of  harvest (Martinez
et al., 1995), mineral nutrition plays a major role
in determining yield and quality of French bean.
Foliar fertilisation can give a better rationalisa-
tion  of  plant  nutrition. It  could  be  used  to  cor-
rect  possible  Mg  deficiencies, even  though  a
wrong  choice  of  Mg  concentration  or  time  of
application  may  have  a  significant  adverse  ef-
fect  on  plant  growth, yield  and  quality.

Most studies on the foliar application of nu-
trients  to  beans  have  focused  on  molybdenum
(Mo), boron  (B)  and  zinc  (Zn). Increasing
molybdenum  fertilization  to  bean  from  14  to
100  g·ha-1 caused  an  increase  in  seed  yield  by
40%, as  a  result  of  favourable  effects  on  struc-
tural  seed  yield  components  (Coelho  et  al.,
1998; Vieira et al., 1998; Amane et al., 1999). Be-
sides, the above increase in molybdenum fertil-
ization  resulted  in  increases  in  plant  fresh  and
dry  matter  (DM), reductases  and  NO3 nitroge-
nase  activities  and  number  of  root  nodules
(Vieira  et  al., 1998).

Boron applied to French bean at an optimal
dose of 1 kg·ha-1 increased pod length, pod num-
ber  plant-1 and  seed  yield  (Kotur, 1998). Other
studies  highlighted  that  foliar  applications  of
phosphorus  (P)  and  B  gave  earlier  flowering
and  higher  pod  yield  (Singh  et  al., 1989). Pad-
ma et al. (1989) found that combined foliar ap-
plications  of  Mo  and  B  increased  plant  height,
number of leaves, flowers and pods, root length
and  assimilation  area  and, above  all, increased
green pod yield to 4.7 t·ha-1, compared to 3 t·ha-1
from  control  plants.

There  is  a  dearth  of  literature  on  foliar  fer-
tilisation  of  French  bean. A  previous  work  re-
lating  to  the  optimal  Mg  concentration  during
early  development  (Duczmal, 1994)  was  per-
formed  in  South America, under  very  different
climatic  conditions  with  respect  to  Mediter-

102

ranean  areas. Moreover, no  research  has  fo-
cused on the combined foliar application of Mg
with  other  nutrients. In  particular, Zn  fertilisa-
tion  has  given  interesting  responses  in  other
crops, in  terms  of  higher  yield  and  fruit  quality
(Barlóg and Grzebisz, 2001); thus, it would seem
appropriate  to  assess  whether  this  latter  ele-
ment may be successfully combined with Mg in
foliar  applications  in  French  beans.

The above mentioned lack of data was a cat-
alyst  to  this  research, which  was  designed  to
study the effect of foliar Mg applications, in sev-
eral rates and timings, on the yield, biomass and
chemical composition of two French bean geno-
types; possible  effects  due  to  the  combined  ap-
plication  of  Mg  with  Zn  were  also  considered.

2. Materials  and  methods

2.1 Crop  condition, experimental  design  and
management
The  work  was  conducted  in  2004  and  2005  in
unheated  greenhouses  of  the  Department  of
Food  Science, University  of Teramo. The  French
bean  cultivars  Bronco  (Seminis)  and  Cadillac
(Royal  Sluis)  were  sown  on  19  March  2004  and
on  24  March  2005  in  small  pots  (5  x  10  x  5  cm)
filled  with  peat:perlite  (2:1  volume  ratio)  and
were  kept  in  a  propagation  greenhouse  until
seedlings  were  approximately  8  cm  high. Subse-
quently, seedlings  were  transplanted  on  10 April
2004 and 16 April 2005 onto experimental green-
house  benches, into  soil  collected  from Villarosa
(Te)  (42° 53’  N, 13° 55’  E)  in  October. The  soil
was  not  of  agricultural  origin, because  it  came
from  an  area  covered  in  native  vegetation  and
had never received any fertiliser, herbicide or pes-
ticide  application. It  was  a  sandy-clay  loam  with
the following characteristics: sand 48%, silt 29%,
clay  23%, pH(H2O)  7.2, electrical  conductivity
(EC)  0.498  mS  cm-1, Cation  Exchange  Capacity
16.67 meq 100 g-1, total CaCO3 1.2%, total organic
matter  1.4%, total  N  1.0  g  kg-1, P  43  mg  kg-1, K
450 mg kg-1, Ca 2300 mg kg-1, Mg 50 mg kg-1, DT-
PA  +  TEA  +  CaCl2 extractable micronutrients
(mg kg-1) Fe 20.6, Mn 6.4, Zn 2.6, Cu 8.8, B 0.46,
Na  55  (Violante, 2000).

The  experimental  design  was  a  split-plot
arranged  as  a  randomised  complete  block  with
three  replicates. The  two  bean  genotypes  were
main-plots, i.e. cv. Bronco, and  cv. Cadillac. The

first genotype is suitable for fresh consumption
while the second is suitable for processing. Eight
combinations of Mg dose and time of foliar ap-
plication  were  sub-plots: i.e. 56, 112, and  224  g
ha-1 of Mg at two stages (whole dose applied at
approximately  onset  of  flowering or  a  half  the
dose at the 4 leaf stage and a half at flowering),
plus  one  treatment  with  Mg  and  Zn  at  224  +
200  g  ha-1 (at  flowering), plus  an  unfertilized
control. The Mg was applied as the commercial
product Brexil Mg (Valagro Spa), while the Zn
was  applied  as  Brexil  Zn  (Valagro  Spa).

Subplots were 3 m x 2 m and consisted of 4
rows of French beans at 50 cm apart sown at 30
plants  m-2 (in-row  plant  distance  of  7  cm). Irri-
gation was provided via a drip system from 300
L tanks. Plants were irrigated twice a week, aim-
ing  at  fully  restoring  field  capacity. Irrigation
water had the following characteristics: pH 7.55,
EC  =  0.578  mS  cm-1, Mg  0.1  µg·l-1.

Foliar  fertilizer  was  applied  with  a  plot
sprayer  fitted  with  four  flat  fan  nozzles  (AL-
BUZ APG  110  –  yellow)  delivering  300  L  ha-1
spray solution at 300 kPa. Before application, a
transparent  PVC  mulch  was  laid  down  on  the
soil  between  crop  rows  to  prevent  nutrient  so-
lution  from  reaching  the  soil  surface  and  thus
avoid  fertilizer  root  uptake. Applications  were
made on 23 May and 5 June in 2004 and 25 May
and 6 June in 2005.

Weeds were controlled by hoeing, at the 2 leaf
stage, and, in both years, deltametrine was applied
to control aphids at the start of flowering.

2.2 Crop  morphology  and  yield
Final harvest was at 58 days after sowing (DAS)
in 2004 and 60 DAS in 2005; total plant biomass
was  partitioned  into  aerial  biomass, roots  and
commercial pods, that were weighed separately.
Commercial  pods  plant-1 were  also  counted.
Samples  from  all  plant  parts  were  dried  in  a
forced draught oven at 80  oC for 48 h to deter-
mine  the  DM  content.

2.3  Chemical  quality  analysis
Total  N  level  was  determined  on  3  g  samples
using  the  Kjeldahl  method.

The  ash  content  of  the  samples  was  deter-
mined by incineration in a muffle furnace (Gal-
lenkamp  hot  box)  at  550  °C  for  24  hours.

For  the  determination  of  soluble  sugars, ni-
trate, phosphate, sulphate, magnesium, calcium,

potassium  content, the  apparatus  used  was  an
ionic  chromatograph  Dionex  Model  ICS  3000
(Dionex corp., Palo Alto, CA, USA). It consists
of  an  anion  separator  column  (Dionex AS14A
column (P/N 056904) with a guard column con-
taining the same resin AG14A (P/N 056897), of
a  cation  separator  column  (Dionex  Ion  Pac
CS12A column (P/N 046073)) with a guard col-
umn containing the same resin Ion Pac CG12A
(P/N 046074) and a carbohydrates separator col-
umn  (Dionex  Carbo  Pac  PA1  (P/N  035391))
with  a  guard  column  containing  the  same  resin
Carbo  Pac  PA1  (P/N  043096). An  anion  sup-
pressor  (AS)  Dionex  ASRS  ULTRA  II  4  mm
was  also  used. The  detectors  were  an  heated
conductivity  cell  (P/N  061830)  and  an  electro-
chemical  cell  (P/N  061757).

All  chemicals  were  chromatographic  grade.
The  eluents  used  to  determine  anion  content
were  0.05  mM  NaHCO3 +  0.05  mM  Na2CO3.
The  eluent  used  to  determine  cation  content
was  0.05  mM  metansulfonic  acid. The  eluent
used  to  determine  carbohydrate  content  was
150  mM  NaOH, previously  treated  with  Star-
sonic 90 (Liarre) at 50 Hz for 15 m. Pump pres-
sure was 12411 Nm-2 for anions and cations and
9308  Nm-2 for  carbohydrates.

Calibration curves for the ions and carbohy-
drates were linear in the concentration range up
to  150  ppm. The  coefficients  of  determination
(R2) for glucose, fructose, sucrose nitrate, phos-
phate, sulphate, magnesium, calcium and potas-
sium were always 0.99. All standard sample ma-
terials  were  purchased  from  Sigma Aldrich  Srl
Italia  (via  Gallarate  154, 20151  Milano).

Sample  preparation  consisted  of  collecting
100 g of commercial green pods which were im-
mersed  in  500  ml  of  deionised  water  and  im-
mediately ground to a fine homogenate with an
Ultra  Turrax  T25  basic  (IKA-WERKE)  for  5
minutes  at  13500  rpm. Subsequently  a  50  ml
aliquot  was  centrifuged  with  ALC  4218  (ALC
International  s.r.l.)  for  10  minutes  at  3500  rpm
and  the  resulting  suspension  filtered  (Acrodisk
syringe  filter  0.2  µm). The  filtered  suspension
was  diluted  with  deionised  water  at  a  1:5  ratio
and injected into the ionic chromatograph. Loop
volume  was  25  µl.

2.4  Statistics
Data were subjected to ANOVA separately for
each  year, to  estimate  the  s.e.d. Differences
among treatments were assessed by using t-tests

(P = 0.05) and, wherever appropriate, the quan-
titative  effects  of  fertilisation  was  assessed  by
linear  regression  analysis. Statistical  analyses
were  performed  using  Statistical  Environment
R  (R  Development  Core Team, 2005).

3. Results

3.1  Biomass  and  yield
Main effects and the genotype x fertilisation in-
teraction were significant (Tab. 1 and 2). On av-
erage  cv. Bronco  produced  more  biomass  than
Cadillac  (15.6  g  DM  and  14.3  g  DM  in  2004,
13.9 g DM and 12.2 g DM in 2005 for cvs. Bron-
co  and  Cadillac, respectively). In  all  cases  aeri-
al  and  root  biomass  increased  with  Mg  fertili-
sation rate and, apart from the case of root bio-
mass  and  cv. Bronco, such  increases  were  lin-
early related to Mg dose with R2 values always
above  0.80  (regression  lines  not  shown).

with  Mg  dose  were  much  higher  with  the  split
Mg application, while adding Zn to the fertiliz-
er  solution  did  not  show  any  significant  effect.
In cv. Cadillac, the difference between single
and split applications did not show a clear pat-
tern  and  in  several  cases  it  was  not  significant.
When Zn was applied, aerial biomass increased,
but  root  biomass  was  not  affected  (Tab. 1).

Pod  yield  (Tab. 2)  increased  with  Mg  doses
and such an effect was much higher in cv. Bron-
co, that  showed  a  higher  average  yield  level
(79.7  vs. 43.7  g  plant-1 in  2004  and  78.7  vs  42.1
g plant-1 in 2005) and higher dose related incre-
ments  (not  shown). In  both  years, the  yield  of
Bronco was higher with split applications. As in
the  case  of  aerial  and  root  biomass, the  differ-
ence  between  single  and  split  applications  in
Cadillac  was  less  clear  and  not  always  signifi-
cant  (Tab. 2).

In  all  cases, the  addition  of  Zn  did  not  sig-

The  number  of  pods  per  plant  followed  a

trend  similar  to  that  of  yield  (Tab. 2).

3.2  Nitrate  and Total  Nitrogen  content
Notwithstanding a higher biomass and yield, cv.
Bronco  had  a  lower  average  nitrate  content  in
pods (151 vs 265 mg kg-1 in 2004 and 144 vs. 258
mg  kg-1 in  2005)  and  total  N  percentage  (3.5  vs
4.2  %  in  2004  and  2.9  vs. 3.6  in  2005), with  re-
spect  to  Cadillac  (Tab. 3).

In  cv. Bronco, nitrate  accumulation  was  the
highest with the highest Mg doses and the split
application  was  more  effective  than  the  single
one (Tab. 3). When Zn was added to the nutri-
ent  solution, pod  nitrate  decreased  slightly  and
not  significantly, compared  to  the  correspond-
ing  single  application  of  Mg  alone. Total  nitro-
gen content was also significantly increased with
Mg-fertilisation, especially  passing  from  25  to
50%  Mg  rate. Zinc  significantly  increased  N
content from 3.2% to 4.0%, on average over the
two  years.

The cv. Cadillac was more responsive to the
increase  in  Mg  fertilisation, with  respect  to
Bronco (Tab. 3). The effect was particularly ap-
parent  in  the  case  of  split  applications  for  ni-
trate  accumulation. Zinc  significantly  increased
nitrate  content, but  not  total  nitrogen.

3.3  Sugar  content
With  regard  to  pod  sugar  content, cv. Bronco
had a higher average glucose (14.9 vs. 10.4 g kg-1
in 2004 and 14.8 vs. 10.3 g kg-1 in 2005) and su-
crose  (0.7  vs  0.4  g  kg-1 in  2004  and  0.6  vs  0.3  g
kg-1 in 2005) concentration than Cadillac. Aver-
age  fructose  content  was  the  same  in  both  cul-
tivars  at  16.0  g  kg-1 in  both  years  (Tab. 4).

In  cv. Bronco, sugar  content  increased  with
Mg dose in all the cases, but the effect was very
small (though statistically significant), except in
the  case  of  sucrose  with  split  Mg  application
(Tab. 4), that  showed  a  very  high  increase
(133%  and  160%  respectively  for  2004  and
2005).

Effects  were  similar  in  cv. Cadillac, but  the
effect  of  split  Mg  application  on  sucrose  con-
tent  was  not  as  marked  as  in  cv. Bronco. Simi-
larly, Zn  increased  sucrose  level  (by  40%  in
2004  and  100%  in  2005), but  less  than  in  cv.
Bronco.

3.4 Ash  and  ion  content
In  terms  of  ash  content, the  interaction  fertili-
sation x variety was not significant and both va-
rieties  responded  to  Mg  with  a  slight  linear
dose-dependent  increase  (regression  lines  are
not shown, see data in Tab. 5). The effect of Zn
was positive and significant in both cultivars and
the ash content increased by 25.2% in cv. Bron-
co and 26.6% in cv. Cadillac, on average in the
two  years.

In cv. Bronco there was a significant increase
in  phosphate  and  sulphate  contents  with  Mg
dose, particularly  passing  from  25  to  50%  Mg
rate. Otherwise, differences  between  single  and
split  applications  were  not  significant  (Tab. 5).
Addition of Zn to the fertiliser mix significant-
ly  enhanced  phosphate  but  not  sulphate 
content.

Cadillac had a higher average phosphate and
sulphate content than Bronco (3834 vs 2643 mg
P Kg -1 in 2004; 3758 vs. 2599 mg P Kg -1 in 2005;
131 vs 102 mg S Kg  -1 in 2004 and 105 vs 77 mg
S  Kg  -1 in  2005), even  though  the  response  to
increased Mg dose was similar to that of Bron-
co  (Tab. 5). The  addition  of  Zn  to  the  fertiliser
mix  did  not  give  any  significant  effect.

With respect to cation macronutrient, in both
varieties  Mg  fertilization  increased  Ca  and  Mg
content  (this  was  significant  only  in  2004)  and
decreased  K  content  (Tab. 6). Cv. Cadillac  had
a  higher  average  content  in  all  cations  with  re-
spect  to  cv. Bronco.

The  effect  of  split  applications  was  signifi-
cant only in the case of cv. Cadillac, with refer-
ence  to  Mg  and  Ca  accumulation.

4. Discussion

The beneficial effect of foliar application of Mg
on French bean plants was evident in total bio-
mass  accumulation  and  yield. It  also  affected
plant  structure, both  bean  cultivars  responded

to  foliar  fertilisation  with 
increased  above
ground biomass, and higher number and weight
of  commercial  pods. This  confirms  findings  by
Pszczól´kowska et  al. (2003)  who  observed  that
Mg  fertilisation  in  white  lupin  (Lupinus  albus
L.) significantly increased seed weight per plant,
number  of  seeds  per  pod and  induced  first  pod
set at a lower node. Reinbott and Blevins (1995)
reported  that  4  foliar  applications  of  a  combi-
nation of B and Mg increased soybean (Glycine
max  (L.)  Merr.)  yield  by  12%  and  4%  at  two
locations  over  3  years. These  effects  can  be  ex-
plained by faster CO2 fixation, due to increased
CO2 uptake  and  RUBP-carboxylase  activity
(Seftor et al., 1986). Fischer et al. (1998) as well
as Fischer and Bremer (1993) suggested that Mg
plays a role in source-sink relationships, favour-
ing  assimilate  translocation  towards  sinks.

The  positive  effect  of  Zn  on  plant  and  root
biomass, not  coupled  with  a  similar  effect  on
yield, matches  the  findings  of  Cakmak  and
Marschener (1986, 1990) who noted that wheat
(Triticum  aestivum  L.)  and  cotton  (Gossypium
hirsutum L.) DM increased as Zn concentration

was increased from a deficit to a sufficient lev-
el. Kaya and Higgs (2002) also found that foliar
Zn  applications  at  0.35  mmol  l-1 enhanced  DM
production  in  two  tomato  (Lycopersicon  escu-
lentum Mill.)  cultivars, but  did  not  affect  yield.
When the Mg fertiliser was applied in a split
application, the  two  varieties  responded  differ-
ently  in  yield  and  biomass  production. This
could be explained from their different growth.
Bronco  has  late  flowering  and  fruit  set, and  a
long  ripening  phase. Cadillac  is  an  earlier  vari-
ety and it may have not been able to effective-
ly utilize the nutrients applied during flowering.
Concerning  nitrogen  and  nitrate  content  in
pods, the observed values were similar to those
determined  for  French  beans  by  Khah  and Ar-
vanitoyannis  (2003)  and  Kirk  and  Sawyer
(1991).

Carbohydrate analyses showed that cv. Bron-
co  contained  higher  average  fruit  sugar  levels
confirming  its  better  suitability  for  processing.
The  increase  in  sucrose, fructose  and  glucose
content  after  Mg  fertilisation  in  both  varieties,
although  very  slight, may  be  explained  by  in-

108

creased  phloem 
loading  and  photosynthate
translocation  towards  sinks  (Cakmak  et  al.,
1994) or by increased sink growth and thus de-
creased  sink-limitation  (Fischer  and  Bremer,
1993; Alaoui-Sossé  et  al., 2004).

With regard to ions content, the effect of Mg
fertilisation on the concentration of Mg in pods
was partly expected even tough an increase was
only  evident  at  high  fertilizer  doses. It  should
be noted that Mg at low rates was antagonistic
to K content, as reported in other legumes (Nar-
wal  et  al., 1985).

Concerning  anions, pod  phosphate  content
was  increased  by  Mg  fertilisation, especially
with a split application at the highest dose. This
confirms results obtained in cucumber (Cucumis
sativus L.), tomato, lettuce  (Lactuca  sativa L.)
(Jarvan  and  Poldma, 2004)  and  broccoli  (Bras-
sica  oleracea L.)  (Demchak  and  Smith, 1990).

5. Conclusions 

Mg fertilisation of French beans increased yield
and quality, with particular reference to pod su-
crose, fructose, and  glucose  as  well  as  nitrate,
phosphate, sulphate  magnesium  and  calcium
content, that  may  be  of  relevance  to  human
health  and  nutrition. However, particular  care
should be taken of the nitrate content, which in
some cases was increased by Mg-fertilisation, es-
pecially  in  cv. Bronco. Even  though  the  effect
was low and the nitrate content was always be-
low the limits of current regulations, this should
be  considered  when  planning  field  applications
of Mg, with reference to the varietal choice and
fertiliser  rate.

From  a  grower’s  perspective, split  applica-
tion  of  Mg  fertilisers  at  two  growth  stages
(fourth  leaf  and  at  flowering)  seems  advisable
to maximise fertiliser efficiency, with no risk of
foliar  damage, particularly  in  the  case  of  vari-
eties  characterised  by  a  long  ripening  phase.

The  addition  of  Zn  to  the  fertiliser  mix, on
the  other  hand, does  not  seem  advisable, as  it
