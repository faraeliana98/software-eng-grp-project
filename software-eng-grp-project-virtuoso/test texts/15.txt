ABSTRACT

Wild flora is an integral component of rural livelihoods and their exploitation has advocated for achieving the optimal
dietary requirements. In this context, the current study presents systemic practice on traditional usage of wild dietary and
medicinal plants in the recent scenarios of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. Ethnobotanical survey recorded
17  plants  belonging  to  14  families  that  are  separately  used  as  food  and  medicine  by  the  indigenous  population. The
present  study  investigates  their  proximate  composition,  mineral  profile,  vitamin  C, -carotene,  and  anti-nutritional
factors. Analysis of the data revealed that the selected species contained significant amount of protein, crude fat, crude
fiber  and  NFE.  The  crude  protein  and  crude  fat  contents  were  ranged  from  3.08  to  13.78%  and  0.89  to  4.13%,
respectively. Vitamin  C content  was  highest in Oxalis  stricta (52.48±5.57 mg 100-1g) and least amount  was found in
Zanthoxylum  alatum (1.650.87 mg  100-1g)  on  fresh  weight  basis. -Carotene  was  found  maximum  in Nasturtium
officinale (209.60 mg 100-1g) followed by Sisymbrium officinale and Rumex hastatus while minimum concentration was
determined  in Zanthoxylum alatum.  Analysis  of  the  mineral  profile  showed  that  potassium  was  present  in  highest
quantity  followed by calcium, phosphorus, sodium and iron. Similarly, anti-nutritional factors  were noted in different
ranges i.e. total oxalates (14.34-362.66), phytic acid (5.97-33.09), tannins (7.27-108.49) mg 100-1 g on fresh weight. It
can be concluded from the present study that the investigated plant species are poor source of anti-nutritional factors and
key source of nutracuticles which advocates the subject plants as wild edible species for human consumptions.
Key words: Wild food, nutraceuticals, biodiversity, proximate, minerals.

INTRODUCTION

to 

The increasing population coupled with poverty,
natural  and  man  made  crisis  in  rural  parts  of  Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa  of  Pakistan  poses  challenges
the
earnings for their livelihoods and access to food. Limited
livelihoods opportunities  followed  by  both  natural  and
man made disasters are the major constraints beyond the
food  insecurity  (Zeller et  al., 2001;  Sher  and  Hussain,
2009).  It  is  generally  observed  that  most  men  in  these
areas  are  engaged  in  un-skilled  labor,  while  women  are
self-employed  in  petty  trade  of  agriculture  especially  in
the  collection  and  trade  of  wild  food  and  medicinal
plants.  Food  availability  and  household  food  security  in
mountain areas are closely related to agriculture (Harlan,
1992;  Ogoye  and  Hansen,  2003).  Moreover, 
the
traditional  ways  of  farming  and  livestock  rearing  have
further  reduced  the  income  opportunity  of  the  local  and
as  a  result  about 60  percent  of  the  population  had  very
low  purchasing  power (Hole,  2005).  Food  is  still  the
single most important commodity in the area accounting
for 80 percent of all expenditures (Asfaw, 1997). In terms
of  current  caloric 
intake,  roughly  40  percent  of
households  in  the  area  could  be  classified  as  food
insecure.  When  current  status  is  combined  with  a
measure  of  vulnerability  (proportion  of  total  household

92

budget  devoted  to  food),  30  percent  of  households  are
classified as food-insecure, and an additional 70 percent
are vulnerable (Sher et al., 2004).

Wild plants contain potential bio-molecules both
in  organic  and  inorganic  combinations  (Penny et  al.,
2002). They are vital, inexpensive and lucrative source of
vitamins, antioxidants, fiber, minerals and other nutrients
for many economical deprived natives. These plants have
high  nutraceutical  value  and  are  used  for  wide  range  of
ailments  and  have  the  potential  to  protect  human  body
from  cancer,  diabetes,  inflammatory  and  cardiovascular
diseases.  Literature  survey  revealed  that  considerable
work has been done on the organic constituents, however,
little attention has been paid to the attributes of inorganic
elements  which  plays  a  very  important  role  in  the
formation  of  the  active  chemical  constituents  and thus
responsible 
therapeutic
properties  (Rajurkar  and  Damame,  1998;  Ray  2004).  A
direct  correlation  between  elemental  content  of  wild
plants and their nutraceutical ability is not yet understood
in  term  of  modern scientific perspectives.  Besides,  the
exploitation of such plants is limited due to the presence
of  some  toxic  and  anti-nutritional  factors  viz.  oxalates,
tannins,  alkaloids  and  saponins,  however,  significant
variation was observed in terms of anti-nutritional factors
among  the  wild  food  plants  (Mathenge,  1997;  Gupta et

for  nutritional  as  well  as 

Shad et al

J. Anim. Plant Sci. 23(1):2013

al., 2005).  However,  several  researchers  reported  that
many  traditional  and  conventional  plants  had  the  same
range of these anti-nutritional factors. Nevertheless, these
bio-molecules  analysis  would  raise  the  awareness  about
the  exploitation  of  these  wild  plants  as  food  and
medicine.

The  present  study  documented 17  wild  plants
used  as  food  and  medicinal  plants  collected  from
different  mountainous  packets  of  Khyber  PakhtunKhwa
Province  of  Pakistan. They  substitute  the  common,
expensive and sometime scarcely available conventional
plant based foods. The low-income dwellers rely on such
plants both for cash and subsistence and can be exploited
because of their high nutritional and therapeutic value.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Location and description of the study area: The study
area is  situated in  the  North  West  and  South-West  of
Pakistan (Coordinates: 34.00 N and 71.32 E). The area
is  spread  over  101741  Km² 
(Britannica  Online
Encyclopedia,  2011).  It
is  a  wide  arable land  with
irrigation  facilities (around 10-12%  is  cultivated). The
estimated population in 2010 is approximately 21 million
(Population Census Organization Pakistan, 2011; Khalil,
2007). It borders Afghanistan to the north-west, makes it
of strategic importance to Pakistan. An interesting feature
in the topography is the junction where the slopes of the
Hindu  Kush  Mountains  on  the Iranian  plateau  and
Eurasian land plate, while peripheral eastern regions are
located  near  the  Indian  subcontinent, give  way  to the
Indus-watered hills approaching South Asia.
Data  collection: A  combination  of  quantitative  and
qualitative  research  methods  was  undertaken  in  various
parts  of  the  study  area.  The  concepts  of  validity  and
reliability  were  applied  for  the  integration  of qualitative
and  quantitative  techniques.  Participatory  techniques
were used to collect information and the main techniques
and  tools  used  for  data  collection  were  household
surveys,  key  informant  interviews  and  focus  group
discussions (Alexiades and Sheldon, 1996; Andrea et al.,
2000a; 2007b).
Sample  collection: The  major  aspects  of  survey  were
information  about  the  respondent/informant,  date  and
place  of  gathering  information,  local  name  of  the  wild
dietary  flora  and  parts  used.  In  this  way,  informants
identified more than 100 trees, herbs and shrubs that are
used for various purposes. However, we exclude all those
plants that  either  could  not  be  identified  or  their  use  is
restricted to medicine only from our study list. Seventeen
wild  plants  were  selected from  subject  area  including
Bajuar,  Buner,  Dir,  D.I.  Khan  and  Swat districts  of  the
Khyber 
Province  which  were
recommended  by  more  than  50%  of  the  informants.

and 

Furthermore, seven species; Berberis lyceum, Nasturtium
officinale, Oxalis  stricta, Plantago  major,  Rumex
hastatus, Sisymbrium officinale and Zanthoxylum alatum
were  collected  from  their  natural  habitat  at  their  mature
stage  They  were  analyzed 
their  proximate
composition, mineral contents, vitamin C, β-carotene and
anti-nutritional factors to evaluate their nutritive value in
human diet.
Proximate composition: Moisture,  ash,  crude  fat  and
crude  protein  were  determined  using 
the  standard
laboratory protocol (AOAC, 2000). Similarly, Vitamin C
was  determined  by  the  dye  reduction  method. For  this
purpose  the  ascorbic  acid  content  of  the  sample  was
titrated  with  2,  6  dichlrophenol  indophenol  (AOAC,
2000; Arya et al., 2000) and β-Carotene was isolated by
column 
estimated
Spectrophotometrically  using  the  modified  method  of
Noelle and Grivetti, (2002).

chromatography 

Nitrogen  free  extract  represents  the  digestible
carbohydrate  and  can  be  found  by  the  difference.  This
value  was  obtained  by  subtracting  the  sum  of  the
percentages of moisture, crude fiber, crude protein, crude
fat and Ash from 100 (Iqtidar and Saleemullah, 2004).
NFE = 100 - % (Moisture + crude fat + crude protein +
crude fiber + Ash)
Energy calculation: The caloric value of the sample was
calculated from the energy yielding components i.e. Fats,
Protein,  Carbohydrate.  The  crude  fat  was  multiplied  by
9.1 and the sum of protein and carbohydrates (NFE) was
multiplied  by  4.3.  The  sum  of  resulting  figures  (fat,
protein and carbohydrate) will be kilo calories (K cal) per
100 g sample (Merrill and Watt, 1973).
Mineral profile analysis: Dried  plant  material,  in
triplicate,  were subjected to wet digestion procedure for
the determination of mineral contents in accordance with
AOAC 
determination  was
accomplished using  molibdate-vanadate  method (Cavell,
1955;  Jackson, 1962).  The  absorbance  of  the  complex
mixture  was  measured  by  a Spectrophotometer  (Model:
OPTIMA  SP-3000  Plus) at  740  nm.  Sodium  and
potassium  were  determined  by 
flame  photometry
technique  (Jenway,  Model  PFP7).  Similarly, Atomic
Absorption  Spectrophotometer (Perkin  Elmer,  model  A
Analyst 700) were used for the determination of Calcium,
Magnesium,
Iron, Zinc,  Cadmium, Lead,  Cupper,
Chromium, Manganese, Selenium and Nickel (AOAC,
2000).
Anti-nutritional factors: Total  oxalate  contents  were
determined  by  extracting  with  hydrochloric  acid and
soluble oxalate with water followed by precipitation with
calcium  oxalate 
from  deproteinized  extract  and
subsequent titration with potassium permanganate (Gupta
et  al., 2005). Total  phenol  contents  in  the  methanolic
extracts were  assessed  using  a  modified  version  of  the

(2000).  Phosphorous

Folin–Ciocalteu assay. Gallic acid was used as a standard
Li et al., 2008). Tannins level in the methanolic extracts
was assessed using the vanillin-HCl method reported by
Waterman  and  Mole  (1994).  Similarly, pytic  acid  was
determined  using  the  method  of  Vaintraub  and  Lapteva
(1988).
Anti-oxidant  Activity: Anti-oxidant  activity  was
determined by using the 2, 2-diphenyl-1-pycril  hydrazyl
(DPPH)  radical  scavenging  assay  as  described  by  Choi
(2002).  DPPH  (1 mL,  0.3 mM) solution  in ethanol was
added to 2.5 mL (100 mg mL-1) of methanol extract and
mixture  was  allowed  to  react  for  30 min.  at  room
temperature  and  absorbance  was  recorded  using  UV
visible spectrophotometer at 518 nm. HPLC grade Rutin
hydrate  (95%,  1 mM) was  used  as  standard,  while
absolute ethanol was  used  as  negative  control.  The
experiment  was  repeated  in  triplicate,  using  fresh  plant
sample each time and the average absorbance values were
converted to percentage anti-oxidant activity.
Statistical analysis: The data was collected in triplicate
and standard error (SE) was calculated according to Steel
et al. (1997).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Dwellers  of  the  subject  area  are  facing  various
contributing  factors  of  malnutrition  such  as  rapid
population  growth, poverty,  natural  and  manmade
disasters. The livelihood of rural inhabitants in particular
is  disturbed  to  a  great  extent  due  to  Afghan  war  and
unabated natural chaos. Wild plants have been recognized
as  the  cheapest  and  most  abundant  source  of  food  and
medicine in the subject area since long. The present study
was  designed  to  document  the  edible  and  remedial
ethnobotanical  awareness  of  the  local  inhabitants  of  the
surveyed  areas.  Furthermore  the  selected  species  were
investigated  for  their  nutraceutical  potential  as  well.
Seventeen wild plants were collected from various region
of  the  subject  area  based  on  their  possible  nutritive  and
pharmacological 
present
ethnobotanical survey. It was found that wild plants were
an integral component of the livelihood of these areas for
diverse  rationale,  round  the  year.  Wild  plants  provided
food in the form of fruits, leaves, roots, seeds, and other
plant parts, either raw or cooked and herbal medicines in
the  form  of  extracts,  decoction,  infusion, syrups  and
milky  latex.  The  general  purposes  of  their  uses  include
dietary  diversification,  increase  food  supply,  flavoring
agent  or  spices,  increase  nutraceuticals  potential  of  diet
and  for  various  human  ailments.  Results  presented  in
Table  1  revealed  that  wild  edible  species are  separately
consumed 
the  study  areas  with  slight  cooking
differences. Similarly,  Hamayun et  al. (2006)  explored
the  ethnobotanical  knowledge  of  district  Swat of KPK,
Pakistan  by  traditional  harvesting  techniques  of  wild

potential, 

during 

the 

in 

fruits  and  edible  portion.  Similarly,  Ahmad and  Javed
(2007) recorded the economic importance of indigenous
uses of 81 selected plants belonging to 44 families, out of
which 35 were used by local community and sold in local
markets. Gilani et al. (2006) also recorded 21 important
herbs  belonging  to  19  families  used  medicinally  by  the
local  inhabitants  in  Abbottabad,  district  KPK  Pakistan.
Some  of  these  wild  plants  are  traded  to  national  herbal
markets and as a result they play a vital role in improving
the  socioeconomic  conditions  of  the  study  area. Reuslts
of our study revealed that Berberis lycium, Debregeasia
saeneb  and Oxalis  stricta
had  medicinal  importance,
while Amaranthus spinosis, Astragalus  anisacanthus,
Caralluma edulis, Nasturtium officinale, Plantago major,
Rumex hastatus and Sisymbrium officinale are important
both as food supplement for animals and local inhabitants
and  other  commercial  uses  such  as  herbal  medicine,
essentials,  fiber  and  vitamins  resources. Findings  of  the
current survey concluded that these wild plants are either
used  separately  or  in  amalgamation  with  others  such  as
wheat/maze flour, spices, meats, potatoes etc.

The  present  study  also  analyzed  seven species
for their proximate composition, mineral profile, vitamin
C, -carotene,  and  anti-nutritional  factors  to  evaluate
their  nutritional  adequacy.  These  dietary  wild  species
were selected on the basis of their possible nutraceutical
and  dietary  potential.  The  species  included Berberis
lycium, Nasturtium  officinale, Oxalis  stricta, Plantago
major, Rumex  hastatus, Sisymbrium  officinale and
Zanthoxylum  alatum.  Analysis  of  the  data  (Table  2)
revealed  that  the  moisture  content  of  the Oxalis  stricta
was  maximum  (84.78±3.62%)  followed  by Nasturtium
officinale (80.08±4.97%).  Minimum  level  of moisture
was found in seed and fruit part of Zanthoxylum alatum
(39.78%).  Maximum  amount  of  ash  (3.07±0.13%)  was
observed  in Nasturtium  officinale followed  by Berberis
lycium (2.78±1.02%),  whereas  minimum  amount  was
found  in Rumex  hastatus (1.480.15%).  Mean  value  of
crude  protein  presented  in  Table  2  revealed  that  the
studied  plants had  protein  content  in  the  range  of  3.08-
13.78%. Similar  values of  proximate  composition have
also  been  reported  by  Aletor  and  Adeogun  (1995)  of
tropical plants of Nigeria while Gopalan et al. (1996) and
Hussain  (2000)
the
conventional  food  and  vegetables of  different  plant
species.  Analysis  of  the  data  also  indicated  that  the
studied plants were moderate sources of fat (0.89-4.13%).
Maximum  amount of  ether-extracted  fat  was  found in
fruit and seed part of Zanthoxylum alatum. Aletor et al.
(2002) reported 2.2% to 7.3% crude protein in fresh leafy
vegetables,  similar  to  the  present  results.  Likewise,
maximum  crude  fiber  content  was  estimated  in Rumex
hastatus (28.43%) followed  by Sisymbrium  officinale
(14.72%).  Minimum  amount  of  fiber  was  found  in
Plantago  major (4.28%).  The  Nitrogen  Free  Extract
(NFE) was found to be the major chemical constituent of

reported  associated  values  for

proximate composition in the selected wild plants used as
food  and  medicines.  Mean  value  of  the  data  (Table  2)
showed  that  highest  amount  of  NFE  was  found  in
Zanthoxylum  alatum (35.57%)  followed  by Plantago
major (8.02%) whereas lowest concentration of NFE was
observed in Oxalis stricta (1.220.45%). Similarly, Table
2  also  suggested  that  the  investigated  plants  were
reasonable  sources  of vitamin  C  and  β-carotene  which
ranged  between  1.65-52.48  and  5.24-209.60  mg  100-1g,
respectively. Highest amount of vitamin C was found in
Oxalis stricta (52.48 mg 100-1g), whereas maximum level
of  β-carotene  was  noted  in Nasturtium officinale. These
results  are confirmed with  those  reported  by Faboya,
(1990), Akpanyung et al. (1995), Sundriyal and Sundriyal
(2000),  Alverez,  (2002),  Sellappan  and  Akoh,  (2002),
Gupta et al. (2005) and Li et al. (2008). Their reported
average  values were 0.50  to 5.77%  ash,  2.7  to  35.88  %
fiber, 0.25 to 33.88% crude protein and 15 to 40% NFE
in  various  wild  plants  used  as  food  and  medicine.

Contrary,  some  researchers  reported  extremely  varied
quantity  of chemical  composition  of  indigenous  wild
spices used as food and medicine (Shingade et al., 1995).
The possible reason could be due to species differences,
different  age/stage  of  the  species  and  different  agro-
climatic conditions.

Anti-nutritional factors are widely distributed in
wild  plants  used  as  food  and  medicine  (Oboh  and
Akindahunsi,  2004)  which  are  responsible  for  several
health  complications.  Several  anti-nutritional  factors
including oxalate, tannins, phytic acid, lignins, saponins,
alkaloids, cyanogens and enzyme inhibitors (Makkar and
Singh,  1993;  Gupta et  al., 2005; Shingade et  al., 1995)
whose  presence  greatly  impair  the  digestion  of  various
nutrients, therefore, reducing the nutritional value of such
plants  and  limiting  their  utilization  as  food  (Gidamis et
al., 2003;  Prathibha et  al., 1995).  Results  presented  in
Table 3 revealed that the investigated plants had lower

level  of  total  oxalates,  soluble  oxalates  and  phytic  acid
whereas  moderate  level  of  Tannins  and  total  phenols,
which  was  found  to  be  in  the  range  of  total  oxalates
(14.34-362.66),  soluble  oxalates  (6.87-211.23),  phytic
acid  (5.97-33.09)  and  tannins  (7.27-108.49)  mg  100-1g.
Similar pattern of anti-nutritional contents of some of the
unconventional  food  plants  were  reported  (Shingade et
al., 1995).  Total  phenols  varied  from  23.35  to  316.66
mg/100  g  in  the  analysed  plants.  Likewise, maximum
value  of  percent  antioxidant  activity  was  observed  in
Sisymbrium  officinale (45.66%),  whereas  minimum  in
Zanthoxylum  alatum (9.67%).  It  can  be  concluded  that
the  wild  edible  species  are  a  good  source  of  various
nutrients (Table 3).

The present study also investigated fourteen (14)
elements (Ca, Mg, Na, K, P, Zn, Cu, Mn, Fe, Se, Cr, Pb,
Ni and Cd) in the studied plants. Table 4 shows the mean
concentration  of  various  elements  in  the  studied  plants
based on the dry weight of the plant. The results revealed
that  different  mineral  matter  of  the  investigated  plants
ranged  from  0.001- 540  mg  100-1 g  (Table  4).  Heavy
metal  contents  were  in  descending  order  of K> Ca> P
>Na>Mg>Fe > Mn > Zn > Cu >Ni >Se whereas Se, Cr,

Ni, Pb and Cd were not detected in some species. Similar
pattern was also reported by Guil et al. (1996), Barminas
et al. (1999) and Maiga et al. (2005). Highest amount of
iron  and  copper  was  found  in Oxalis  stricta (7.283  mg
100-1g)  and Zanthoxylum  alatum (6.34  mg  100-1g),
respectively whereas  maximum  amount  of  zinc  and
selenium was found in Rumex hastatus (0.073 mg 100-1g)
and Berberis lycium (0.049 mg 100-1g ), respectively as
compared  to  other  species.  Manganese  content  varied
from 0.016 mg 100-1g (Berberis lycium) to 0.052 mg 100-
1g (Oxalis  stricta).  Zn  plays  an  important  role  as  an
antioxidant in animal (Bray and Betteger, 1990) as  well
as in plant membranes (Din et al., 1996). This may be the
possible  reason  that  wild  plants  are  considered  good
antioxidant sources (Kumari et al., 2004). Latest research
confirms  the  role  of  wild  plants  as bio-indicator  and
accumulator for atmospheric and soil pollution (Bonanno
and Giudice, 2010; Ruiz and Velasco, 2010; Al-Yemni et
al., 2011). Results of the present study revealed that the
studied  plants  were  poor  sources  of  lead,  cadmium,
chromium  and  nickel. The  nickel  content  ranged  from
0.012-0.083  mg  100-1g,  however,  in  some  species  the
concentration was not detectable.
