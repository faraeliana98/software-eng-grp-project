Introduction

Abstract
The antioxidant activity, total phenols content and phytochemical constituents of edible portions 
of four underutilised tropical fruits; Irvingia gabonensis (African mango), Artocarpus altilis 
(breadfruit), Annona muricata (soursop) and Annona squamosa (sweetsop) were determined. 
Extracts of fruit samples were screened for selected phytochemicals using standard methods 
whereas the total phenols content and antioxidant activity (by free radical scavenging action) 
was determined by the Folin-Ciocalteu method and DPPH assay, respectively. The antioxidant 
activities were high with values ranging from 63% inhibition (breadfruit) to 78% inhibition 
(African mango pulp). African mango seeds had the highest total phenols content (20.96 mg 
GAE  /100g).    Tannins,  triterpenoids,  saponins,  sterols,  cardiac  glycosides,  flavanoids  and 
coumarins were detected in most of the fruit extracts. The study revealed that these underutilised 
tropical fruits have considerable free radical scavenging (antioxidant) activity and an array of 
phytochemicals necessary to significantly impact health of consumers.

Highly reactive free radicals present in biological 
systems  arise 
from  cell  metabolic  activities 
(prominently, oxidation) (Pisoschi et al., 2009) and 
external factors such as tobacco smoke, UV radiation 
and  other  environmental  pollutants  (Murillo  et 
al.,  2012).  These  initiate  degenerative  reactions  in 
biological systems resulting in secondary damage to 
biological  molecules  especially  the  biomembranes 
such  as  proteins,  lipids  and  nucleic  acids  (Pisoschi 
et al., 2009). Many human disorders viz., coronary 
heart diseases, atherosclerosis, aging, some cancers, 
chronic  fatigue  and Alzheimer’s  disease  have  been 
attributed  to  the  degenerative  reactions  of  these 
oxidising agents (Liu, 2003; Sochor et al., 2010). 

Biological  systems  are  in  equilibrium  when 
the  effects  of  these  reactive  species  are  offset  by 
the  activity  of  inherent  antioxidants  which  may  be 
enzymes  or  non-enzymatic  compounds.  Thus,  the 
antioxidant activity of a system gives a measure of 
its protective abilities against degenerative/ oxidative 
reactions induced by oxidising agents (Sochor et al., 
2010). However, most human cells unlike plant cells 
do  not  generate  adequate  amounts  of  antioxidants 
to  protect  them  against  oxidative  reactions  of  the 
produced  reactive  species  (Pisoschi  et  al.,  2009) 

thus,  the  need  to  look  for  more  dietary  sources 
of  antioxidants  (Liu,  2003).  The  demand  is  more 
pronounced in this era of increased number of non-
communicable diseases (NCDs) worldwide. This is 
especially so for developing nations where the rise 
in the NCDs is being battled alongside the existing 
menace  of  infectious  diseases  (Anonymous,  2006; 
Hall et al., 2009).

Fruits  represent  one  such  source  of  dietary 
antioxidants  (Liu,  2003;  Kolar  et  al.,  2011) 
thereby  necessitating  the  call  for  their  increased 
consumption  in  recent  times  (Hall  et  al.,  2009). 
The  total  antioxidant  (free  radical  scavenging) 
activity of fruits is mainly attributed to the additive 
and  synergistic  effects  of  inherent  phytochemicals 
notably, the phenolic compounds (Liu, 2003; Cartea 
et al., 2011).  In addition to their antioxidant activity, 
phytochemicals also impart other peculiar beneficial 
toxicological/  pharmacological  effects  in  humans. 
Thus,  a  measure  of  the  free  radical  scavenging 
activity  and  phytochemical  composition  of  fruits 
gives  an  indication  of  the  potential  health  benefits 
to  be  derived  from  their  consumption  (Liu,  2003; 
Pisoschi  et  al.,  2009;  Vera  de  Rosso,  2013).  It  is 
known  that  natural  sources  of  antioxidants  such  as 
fruits and vegetables are more advantageous to health 
than  the  synthetic  counterparts/supplements  (Liu, 
2003).

Despite  extensive  research  on  the  antioxidant 
activity  and  phytochemical  composition  of  most 
common  fruits,  little  is  known  about  the  many 
tropical  underutilised  fruits  in  developing  nations. 
Ghana faces a similar challenge with its myriad of 
underutilised tree fruits (Abebrese et al., 2007). In a 
bid to contribute to measures aimed at emphasising 
diets  in  preventive  health-care  (Hall  et  al.,  2009), 
the  edible  portions  of  local  varieties  of  four  such 
underutilised  fruits,  Annona  squamosa  (sweetsop 
pulp),  Annona  muricata  (soursop  pulp),  Irvingia 
gabonensis  (African  mango  -  pulp  and  seeds)  and 
Artocarpus altilis (breadfruit pulp) were studied. The 
fruit samples were screened for the presence of major 
phytochemicals  and  their  total  antioxidant  activity 
determined 
their  potential  protective 
benefits  against  degenerative  reactions  induced  by 
free radicals. The obtained data also provides baseline 
information on the fruits for further research works.

Materials and Methods 

Source of materials

Irvingia gabonensis and Artocarpus altilis fruits 
were obtained from the Kwame Nkrumah University 
of  Science  and  Technology  (KNUST)  campus 
whereas  those  of  Annona  muricata  and  Annona 
squamosa  were  purchased  from  local  markets  in 
Kumasi and Accra, respectively. All chemicals used 
were analytical grade reagents.

Sampling and preliminary sample preparation 

Fruits were taken to the laboratory, sorted, washed 
under running water, dried and then weighed. In all, 
sixty African mangoes, five breadfruits, ten soursop 
and twenty sweetsop fruits with average weights of 
195 g, 1267 g, 415 g and 177 g, respectively were 
selected for use. The samples were peeled and where 
applicable,  the  seeds  removed  from  the  pulp.  The 
pulp of African mango and breadfruit were reduced 
to  a  thickness  of  0.2  mm  with  a  laboratory  slicer 
(Model  ART  NO.S-727,  China)  while  the  African 
mango seeds were reduced to a similar thickness with 
a stainless steel knife.  

Prepared  samples  were  bagged  in  pre-weighed 
zip-lock pouches and then frozen for 2 - 5 days at 
-20oC  prior  to  freeze-drying.  The  stored  samples 
were  freeze-dried  in  a  vacuum  freeze-drier  (Model 
YK – 118 - 50, True Ten Industrial Co. Ltd, Taiwan) 
for  44  h  prior  to  the  various  determinations.    The 
freeze-dried  samples  were  then  milled  (Thomas 
scientific mini-miller; Model 3383-L70), sieved with 
an  impact  lab  test  sieve  of  pore-size  400/425  µm 
(Model BS410 – 1:2000) bagged in zip-lock pouches 

and then stored at – 20oC prior to analysis.

Determination of antioxidant activity (AOA) 

The  freeze-dried  samples  were  weighed  into 
5  mg  portions  using  a  weighing  balance  (Mettler 
Toledo.XP 105 Delta Range) into separate eppendorf 
tubes.  1.0  ml  of  methanol  was  then  added  to  each 
sample,  vortexed  (Vortex  V-1  Plus  BM  BIO)  and 
then  sonicated  (Astrason  TM  Ultrasonic  Cleaner 
Model) for 2 h. The solution was decanted and the 
supernatant  hereafter  referred  to  as  fruit  extract, 
used for the AOA determinations by the DPPH assay 
according to Ghasemi et al. (2009). The DPPH assay 
is fairly simple and quick to use and has been widely 
used in assessing the AOA of foods (Pisoschi et al., 
2009; Sharma and Bhat, 2009). It also has the ability 
to efficiently measure the total AOA of the substrate 
(under study) without necessarily being specific to any 
particular antioxidant present (Prakash et al., 2001; 
Sharma and Bhat, 2009). The results were expressed 
as percentage inhibition of the DPPH radical which 
was calculated according to the equation: 

% DPPH =   

Where,  Absorbance  of  blank  is  the  absorbance  of 
DPPH solution without extracts. All determinations 
were carried out at least in duplicates.

Phytochemical screening

The phytochemical screening was done following 
the standard testing protocols as previously reported 
(Trease and Evans, 2002; Onike, 2010; Tiwari et al., 
2011). 

Determination of total phenolics 

Sample  extraction  was  performed  as  described 
for the AOA determination above. The total phenolic 
content of the methanolic extract of each fruit was 
determined  using 
the  Folin-Ciocalteu  method 
described by Waterhouse (2002). The total phenolic 
content  was  expressed  as  Gallic  Acid  Equivalents 
(GAE)  in  milligrams  per  100  g  of  fruit.  All 
determinations were carried out at least in duplicates.

Statistical analysis

The  results  obtained were  analyzed statistically 
using  SPSS  (v.20,  IBM  SPSS  Statistics,  US)  The 
mean  total  phenol  content  and  antioxidant  activity 
of the four fruits samples were compared using one-
way  ANOVA  followed  by  LSD  post  hoc  multiple 
comparisons.  Statistical  significant  difference  was 
performed at α  = 0.05

Results and Discussion

Antioxidant activity (AOA) of fruit samples 

The studied fruits showed fairly high free radical 
scavenging  (antioxidant)  activities  against  DPPH 
compared to the activity of the synthetic antioxidant, 
BHT (91.76%) (Figure 1). African mango pulp and 
sweetsop  had  free  radical  scavenging  activities  of 
75.45% and 68.10% inhibition, respectively. African 
mango seeds, Soursop, and breadfruit also had free 
radical  scavenging  activities  of  60.56%,  75.39% 
and 61.93% inhibition, respectively. These findings 
corroborate previous reports by Agbor et al. (2011), 
Kolar  et  al.  (2011)  and  Murillo  et  al.  (2012)  for 
Cameroonian, Indian and Panama varieties of soursop, 
breadfruit  and  African  mango  seeds,  respectively. 
The  obtained AOA  of  the  underutilised  fruits  also 
compared favourably with that of apple pulp (69.1% 
inhibition) (Leontowicz et al., 2003) as well as being 
superior in terms of their AOA to some other common 
fruits such as banana with AOA of 26.55% - 29.38% 
inhibition  for  two  varieties  (Fatemeh  et  al.,  2012) 
and orange with 47.5% - 49.2% inhibition (Klimczak 
et al., 2006). Rawat et al. (2010) and Murillo et al. 
(2012) proposed the AOA as an important parameter 
in measuring the health and nutritional potential of 
fruits. A review by Liu (2003) also confirmed this and 
suggested the different mechanisms of antioxidants 
(prominently,  scavenging  of  free  radicals)  to  be 
responsible  for  the  inverse  relations  between  their 
consumption and many non-communicable diseases 
including coronary heart diseases, diabetes and some 
cancers. Thus, the fairly high free-radical scavenging 
capacity (AOA) of the edible portions of the studied 
underutilised fruits is desirable in seeking optimum 
health of the populace.

Phytochemical constituents 

The detected phytochemicals of fruit extracts are 
shown in Table 1. On the whole, tannins and glycosides 
were detected in all the samples while saponins were 
detected in all except sweetsop. Triterpenoids were

against DPPH. Plots with different alphabets indicated on 
top  are  statistically  different  (P  <  0.05). AMP- African 
mango pulp; AMS- African mango seeds; BF- breadfruit; 
SoS- soursop;  SwS- sweetsop
also  detected  in  all  the  samples  except  in  soursop. 
Sterols and flavanoids were detected in three out of 
the  five  samples  whereas  coumarins  were  present 
in  only  breadfruit  and  soursop. Alkaloids  were  not 
detected in any of the fruit extracts.

Tannins  are  acclaimed  for  their  free-radical 
scavenging activity, antimicrobial, antiviral and anti-
inflammatory properties (Akiyama et al., 2001). Thus, 
the detection of tannins in all the extracts indicates 
the potential health benefits of the fruits. It is worth 
mentioning  that  the  tannin  content  of  these  fruits 
when ripe is just adequate to prevent the astringent 
and  bitter taste imparted by  tannins  to  some  plant-
based foods (Adekunle and Oyerinde, 2004; Etebu, 
2012).

Saponins were detected in African mango (seeds 
and  pulp),  soursop  and  breadfruit  in  harmony  with 
reports  by  Wolfe  et  al.  (2010),  Etebu  (2012)  and 
Onyechi  et  al.  (2012)  respectively.  Saponins  are 
common in most plants and have been postulated to 
have  a  wide  range  of  biological  activity  including 
antioxidant,  anticarcinogenic  as  well  as  having 
immunostimulant  properties  thereby  exhibiting  the 
potential  to  cure  a  number  of  diseases  (Trease  and 
Evans, 2002). It is noteworthy that although Francis 
et al. (2002) reported adverse effects of some types

of  saponins  on  fishes  (and  other  aquatic  lives),  the 
researchers  also  indicated  the  associated  health 
beneficial properties (to humans) of those found in 
edible fruits thereby eroding any cause for alarm in 
the consumption of these fruits.  

The  general  test  for  glycosides  gave  a  positive 
inference for all the samples. Glycosides collectively 
represent  compounds  with  a  pharmacologically 
active genin and at least one reducing sugar. Specific 
tests for cyanogenic glycosides had negative results 
for all the samples. It has however been reported to 
be present in minute amounts in sweetsop (Coronel, 
1986). The absence of cyanogenic glycosides in the 
fruits  is  desired  because  of  the  toxicity  associated 
with the intake of this compound. However, Onike 
(2010)  suggested  relaxant  and  calming  effects  by 
the  chemical  on  the  heart  and  muscles  when  it  is 
consumed in small doses.

Tests  for  cardiac  glycosides  gave  positive 
inferences  for  African  mango  seeds,  soursop  and 
sweetsop. Usunomena (2012) reported the importance 
of  cardiac  glycosides  in  treating  congestive  heart 
failure  thus  its  presence  in  these  fruits  is  much 
desired.  Moreover,  the  findings  support  a  review 
by Dembitsky et al. (2011) in which the researchers 
suggested the potential of soursop and sweetsop in 
the  treatment  of  cardiac-related  ailments  (as  used 
in  folkloric  medicine)  by  analysing  their  cardiac 
glycoside composition.

Flavanoids were detected in African mango (pulp 
and  seeds)  and  soursop.  The  findings  corroborates 
earlier  detections  for  some  Nigerian  varieties  by 
Wolfe et al. (2010) for African mango seeds, Etebu 
(2012)  for African  mango  pulp  and  Onyechi  et  al. 
(2012) for soursop. Flavanoids are acclaimed for their 
antioxidant and antimicrobial activity (Dembitsky et 
al., 2011). The absence of flavanoids in the studied 
breadfruit and sweetsop samples is in agreement with 

reports of non-detection by Ragone (2011) for some 
breadfruit varieties in the Pacific Islands and EFSA 
(2009) for sweetsop from the Philippines. 

A positive inference for coumarins was obtained 
for  soursop  and  breadfruit.  Adewole  and  Ojewole 
(2008)  reported  the  presence  of  coumarins  in 
soursop  but  there  is  dearth  of  data  on  its  presence 
in  breadfruit.  Coumarins  were  not  detected  in 
sweetsop and African mango (both pulp and seeds) 
in the study. Coumarins are not usually assessed in 
the  phytochemical  analysis  of  most  fruits  (EFSA, 
2009;  Wolfe  et  al.,  2010;  Etebu,  2012)  resulting 
in  a  dearth  of  information  on  them.  According  to 
Trease  and  Evans  (2002)  however,  coumarins  are 
anti-stress  compounds  that  are  postulated  to  have 
antiviral  (including  anti-  HIV)  activity.  They  are 
also employed as oral-anticoagulants – an essential 
agent in the treatment of arterial thrombosis. Thus, 
their detection in breadfruit and soursop shows added 
potential benefits of the fruits.

The  presence  of  sterols  as  observed  in African 
mango (pulp; seeds) and breadfruit is in accordance 
with a report by Amarasinghe et al. (2008). It was not 
detected in soursop contrary to a report by Adewole 
and Ojewole (2008) and also not detected in sweetsop. 
Awad  and  Fink  (2000)  suggested  strong  inverse 
relations  between  intake  of  plant  sterol  and  risk  of 
some cancers. This was corroborated by De Stafani 
et al. (2000) in a controlled case-study that showed 
the  consumption  of  plant  sterols  to  be  inversely 
proportional  to  the  occurrence  of  stomach  cancer. 
The  detection  of  this  plant  chemical  in  breadfruit 
and  African  mango  (pulp  and  seeds)  therefore,  is 
desirable.

The  general  test  for  triterpenoids  on  the  other 
hand,  gave  positive  inferences  for  all  the  samples 
except for soursop. The detection of the chemical in 
breadfruit and African mango seeds has been reported 
by Wang et al. (2006) and Wolfe et al. (2010) but data 
on its presence in African mango pulp and sweetsop 
is  scarce  although  it  was  detected  in  this  study. 
Sweetsop  which  tested  positive  to  triterpenoids 
had  a  negative  inference  for  the  sterol  test.  This 
corroborates an assertion by Trease and Evans (2002) 
that all sterols are triterpenoids but the vice-versa is 
untrue.  Varadharajan  et  al.  (2012)  reported  wound 
healing properties responsible for wound contraction 
and  epithelialisation  by  triterpenoids  –  a  potential 
that makes their presence in foods desirable. 

All the fruit extracts showed negative inferences 
to  the  test  for  alkaloids.  Alkaloids  have  not  been 
detected  in  sweetsop  (EFSA,  2009)  and  breadfruit 
(Ragone,  2011)  but  have  been  detected  in African 
mango  seeds  and  pulp  (Etebu,  2012)  as  well  as  in 

Boakye et al./IFRJ 22(1): 262-268the  mesocarp  of  soursop  (EFSA,  2009).  However, 
Etebu  (2012)  showed  a  decline  in  alkaloid  content 
of African mango mesocarp with increasing storage 
duration  suggesting  the  need  for  the  analysis  to  be 
done on fresh samples for an adequate assessment. 
On the whole, the array of phytochemicals detected in 
the extracts of the underutilised fruits, further indicate 
their  potential  contribution  to  health  especially  in 
areas where they are abundant.

Total phenolic compounds

Quantification of the total soluble phenols detected 
is shown in Figure 2. The values ranged from 3.71 
mg GAE/100g for breadfruit to 20.95 mg GAE/100g 
for African  mango  seeds.  However,  limited  studies 
on these underutilised fruits viz., Agbor et al. (2005) 
(on  African  mango  seeds  from  Cameroun),  Kolar 
et al. (2011) on some Indian varieties of breadfruit 
and  Vera  de  Rosso  (2013)  on  sweetsop  varieties 
from Brazil reported comparatively higher phenolic 
contents than the obtained values for this study.

The  variations  may  be  attributed  to  varietal 
differences resulting from different climatic and pre-
harvest conditions as well as genotypic differences as 
suggested by Rawat (2011) who reported significant 
source  specific  variations  in  the  phenolic  contents 
of  the  same  species  of  some  fruits.  Agbor  et  al. 
(2005) and Deng et al. (2012) also reported phenolic 
constituents of plant foods to be either hydrophilic 
and/  or  lipophilic  -  suggesting  their  analysis  to  be 
invariably  influenced  by  the  solvent  employed, 
extraction methods and length of the extraction. 

These  factors  may  also  have  contributed  to  the 
fairly low content obtained indicating the need for an 
in-depth study of the nature of the inherent phenolics 
of the studied fruits in-order to adequately quantify 
them.  In  spite  of  this  shortfall,  the  phenol  content 
of the African mango seed (20.95 mg GAE/100g) is 
comparable to that of pineapple with 20.20 – 26.20 
mg  GAE/100g  and  mango  with  20.0  –  40.0  mg 
GAE/100g (Nixwell et al., 2013) further indicating 
the  potential  of  the  underutilised  fruits  as  alternate 
dietary antioxidant sources for optimal health. 

Phenolic  compounds  being  part  of  the  total 
phytochemical composition of plants are acclaimed 
for  their  high  free  radical  scavenging  ability  in 
addition to having other disease prevention potential 
such  as  being  antimicrobial,  antiviral  and  anti-
inflammatory agents (Gui-Fang et al., 2012; Oskana 
et al., 2012). However, taken as a whole, there was 
non-significant  correlation  (P  <  0.05)  between  the 
total soluble phenolics of the fruits and their AOA. 
This supports the suggestion by Murillo et al. (2012) 
that  the  total  phenolics  of  different  fruit  species 

266

have different degrees of contributions to their AOA 
and  the  relationship  observed  in  one,  cannot  be 
generalised for all others.

Conclusion

The  studied  underutilised  tropical  fruits  had 
fairly  high  antioxidant  (free  radical  scavenging) 
activity. Generally, the fruit extracts showed positive 
inferences to the major phytochemicals tested except 
for  the  presence  of  alkaloids.  These  include  the 
presence  of  coumarins  in  breadfruit  and  soursop, 
cardiac glycosides in soursop, sweetsop and African 
mango  seeds  as  well  as  triterpenoids  in  African 
mango pulp and sweetsop. Thus, there are potential 
health benefits to be derived from the incorporation 
of these fruits into diets and this indicates the need 
for their exploitation in seeking optimum health of 
the populace.
