1. Introduction

The Chlamydomonas reinhardtii starch-less mutant, BAF-J5, was found to store lipids up to 65% of dry cell
weight when grown photoheterotrophically and subjected to nitrogen starvation. Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy was used as a high-throughput method for semi-quantitative measurements of
protein, carbohydrate and lipid content. The fatty acids of wild-type and starch mutants were identiﬁed
and quantiﬁed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry. C. reinhardtii starch mutants, BAF-J5 and I7,
produce signiﬁcantly elevated levels of 16:0, 18:1D9, 18:2D9,12 and 18:3D9,12,15 fatty acids. Long-chain sat-
urated, mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids were found under nitrogen starvation. Oleosin-like and
caleosin-like genes were identiﬁed in the C. reinhardtii genome. However, proteomic analysis of isolated
lipid bodies only identiﬁed a key lipid droplet associated protein. This study shows it is possible to
manipulate algal biosynthetic pathways to produce high levels of lipid that may be suitable for conver-
sion to liquid fuels.

Microalgae are able to produce considerable amounts of lipids,
up to 70% dry cell weight, that can be used as a feedstock for liquid
fuel production (Hu et al., 2008; Metzger and Largeau, 2005). A
substantial proportion of the total lipid is often triacylglycerol
(TAG) neutral lipids (Tonon et al., 2002). TAGs are synthesised
and stored within lipid body organelles that accumulate in re-
sponse to environmental stresses such as high light or nutrient
deprivation (Guschina and Harwood, 2006; Hu et al., 2008). Several
attempts have been made to increase lipid productivity in microal-
gae (Sheehan et al., 1998). Initial genetic engineering attempts to
increase microalgal lipid content by up-regulating the ﬁrst com-
mitted step of fatty acid synthesis through overexpression of acet-
yl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase) were not successful (Dunahay et al.,
1996). Much remains to be discovered about the regulation of lipid
biosynthesis and catabolism in microalgae.

The model eukaryotic green alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii,
has a well characterised genome and physiology (Merchant et al.,
2007) that provides many advantages for investigating the regula-
tion of metabolic pathways. Although C. reinhardtii has not been
considered an oleaginous microalga, the study of lipid biosynthesis
and lipid body biogenesis in this organism may provide knowledge
that can be transferred to species that may be more suited for large

scale biofuel production. C. reinhardtii preferentially stores carbon
as starch with only low levels of lipid when nutrient deprived (Ball
et al., 1990).

C. reinhardtii sta1 (Ball et al., 1991) and sta6 (Zabawinski et al.,
2001) mutants with deﬁciencies in ADP-Glucose pyrophosphory-
lase (AGPase), the rate limiting step of starch synthesis, have re-
cently been demonstrated to store neutral lipids in lipid bodies
under nitrogen deprivation (Li et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2009).
Starch and lipid synthesis share common 3-carbon photosynthate
precursors from the Calvin cycle. Mutations affecting starch bio-
synthesis result in the diversion of carbon to lipid under auto-
trophic and photoheterotrophic conditions, but has not been
demonstrated under heterotrophic conditions (Li et al., 2010;
Wang et al., 2009). The lipid bodies contained predominantly sat-
urated and unsaturated C16 and C18 fatty acids stored as TAG
and some protein (Li et al., 2010; Moellering and Benning, 2010;
Wang et al., 2009). There have been no reports of long-chain fatty
acids in the wild-type and starch mutant strains under nutrient
deprivation. C. reinhardtii wild-type and cell wall mutant strains
were shown to increase in size under nutrient deprivation (Dean
et al., 2010; Van Donk et al., 1997). The starch-less cell wall defec-
tive mutant, BAF-J5 (cw15 arg7-7 nit1 nit2 sta6-1::ARG7) and its cell
wall defective parental strain 330 (cw15 arg7-7 nit1 nit2) increase
in size, undergo autophagy and are susceptible to lysis when nitro-
gen starved (Wang et al., 2009).

Lipid bodies are dynamic organelles that provide storage for
neutral lipids. In microalgae, the understanding of lipid body bio-
genesis and the metabolism of stored lipids is undeveloped. In

higher organisms, the proteins associated with lipid bodies have
structural and regulatory roles for lipid metabolism. Oleosins and
caleosins are integral lipid body proteins found in the oil seeds
and other tissues of terrestrial plants (Murphy, 2001). Caleosin
homologues have been previously reported in algal genomes
(Wang et al., 2009), but no putative olesins have been identiﬁed.
Recent proteomic analyses of isolated lipid bodies in C. reinhardtii
(Moellering and Benning, 2010) characterised a protein associated
with lipid bodies. This protein, major lipid droplet protein (MLDP)
was shown to be sufﬁciently hydrophobic to associate with lipid
bodies and speciﬁc to green algae. The MLDP gene is expressed un-
der nitrogen deprivation and its silencing led to an increase in lipid
body size suggesting a structural role for this protein in lipid body
regulation (Moellering and Benning, 2010).

The potential for C. reinhardtii to synthesise high levels of fatty
acid under nitrogen limited induction was evaluated. The reference
wild-type strains, cc-124 and cc-125, were compared to the starch
mutants, I7 and BAF-J5, in nitrogen sufﬁcient and deﬁcient growth
conditions. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was applied to
measure carbon partitioning into lipid and carbohydrate. Gas chro-
matography–mass spectrometry (GC/MS) was used to identify and
quantify the fatty acids of C. reinhardtii wild-type and mutant
strains. Finally, proteomic analysis was used to identify the lipid
body-associated proteins in a starch-less mutant.

2. Methods

All water was deionised to a minimum conductivity of

18.2 MX cm and other reagents were of analytical grade.

benzo[a]phenoxazine-5-one, Sigma–Aldrich, Technical grade).
Scans of algal cells were taken with a 40 objective at a pixel res-
olution of 1024  1024 in 8-bit format (pixel intensity range 0–
255). Laser transmission and scan settings were constant in all scans.
Raw images were imported into ImageJ (version 1.41q, National
Institutes of Health, USA) for selection of representative cells.

2.4. Fluorescence spectroscopy

Fluorescence spectra were obtained with a FluoroMax-3
Spectroﬂourometer (HORBIA Jobin Yvon) at a spectral resolution
of 1 nm. Samples were excited at a wavelength of 488 nm (2 nm
slit width) and emission spectra acquired over the range of 500–
800 nm (0.5 nm slit width). Algal cultures were diluted to a
standard concentration of Abs750 = 0.2. Triplicate samples of 2 mL
cultures were stained for 1 min with Nile Red solution, dissolved
in acetone, to a ﬁnal concentration of 1.765 lg mL 1, for semi-
quantitative measurements. Nile Red ﬂuorescence was assessed
continually throughout the time-course experiments by signal
control measurements in acetone.

2.5. Preparation of FTIR samples

Algal samples (0.5 mL) were washed with water to isolate cellu-
lar components from the growth medium. Cells were pelleted by
centrifugation (16,000g, 5 min) the supernatant was discarded
and the cell pellet resuspended in deionised water. Samples were
dried under nitrogen purge and sample concentrations were ad-
justed so that the absolute absorbance of the amide I band at
1657 cm 1 was between 0.5 and 1.0 a.u.

2.1. Strains and growth conditions

2.6. Measurement of FTIR spectra

The C. reinhardtii starch-less mutant BAF-J5 (cw15 arg7-7 nit1
nit2 sta6-1::ARG7) and low starch mutant I7 (mt  nit1 nit2 sta1-
1) were compared to the reference wild-type strains cc-124 (mt 
agg-1 nit1 nit2) and cc-125 (mt+ agg-1+ nit1 nit2) under nitrogen
sufﬁcient and deﬁcient conditions. The strains were grown photoh-
eterotrophically in 250 mL ﬂasks containing 200 mL of the Tris/
Acetate/Phosphate (TAP) medium (Gorman and Levine, 1966) on
an orbital
illumination
(100 lmol ± 5 photons m 2 s 1) at 25 °C with standard air CO2 lev-
els. Starter cultures were grown in TAP medium to stationary
phase whereupon, 100 mL of starter culture was centrifuged
(800g, 10 min, 25 °C), pelleted and washed with their respective
growth medium (50 mL) before inoculating into fresh medium
(200 mL). All cultures were washed and inoculated into TAP or
TAP-N medium at an initial absorbance of Abs750 = 0.8 ± 0.06 (S.D.).

2.2. Growth rates

Optical density (Abs750) was measured with an Ultrospec 2000
UV/visible spectrophotometer
(Pharmacia Biotech) and cells
counted using a haemocytometer to establish growth curves. Cell
doubling time (Td) was calculated using the following formula:
Td ¼ logDðcellÞ
.

log2

2.3. Confocal microscopy

Fluorescence and transmission images were acquired using a
Zeiss LSM 5 PASCAL confocal microscope system with PASCAL ver-
sion 4.0 software (Jena, Germany). The microscope was ﬁtted with
LASOS HeNe 543 nm and Argon 488 nm scanning lasers (Jena,
Germany). Algal cultures (1 mL) were immobilised with iodine
solution (5 lL, 0.25 g iodine in 100 mL 95% ethanol) and stained
with
(9-diethylamino-5H-

Mid-frequency FTIR spectra were recorded with a Bruker Vertex
80 V (Bruker Optik GmbH) at a spectral resolution of 4 cm 1. The
spectra were acquired with a 3-bounce diamond attenuated total
reﬂectance (ATR) sampling accessory (Smiths Detection-Scientiﬁc,
CT) that was heated to 40 °C with a custom water jacket. The spec-
tra were acquired with a DTGS detector from 64 mirror scans.
Background single beam spectra were recorded from the empty
ATR plate under nitrogen purge. Sample single beam spectra were
recorded from the dried algal cells under nitrogen purge. Baseline
offset corrections were made to the absorption spectra, as required,
using the OPUS control software (version 6.5, Bruker Optik GmbH).

2.7. Preparation of GC/MS samples

Algal cultures (100 mL) representing 40–90 mg dcw, were har-
vested by centrifugation (3220g, 20 min at 25 °C). The cell pellet
was frozen in liquid nitrogen and freeze-dried (FTS Systems,
Flexi-Dry) for 4 days at  50 °C and 100–200 mTorr.

2.8. Fatty Acid Methyl Ester (FAME) derivative preparation

Fatty Acid Methyl Esters were prepared by direct transesteriﬁ-
cation as described by Lewis et al. (2000). The dried sample was
weighed (2–3 mg) into duplicate 10 mL screw-top Teﬂon tubes
into which the transesteriﬁcation reagents, methanolic hydrochlo-
ric acid (1 mL, 3N, Sigma–Aldrich) and chloroform (100 lL) and the
internal standard (60 lL, 12.56 mg mL 1 heptadecanoic acid, Sig-
ma) were added. The cells and reaction solution were mixed and
heated at 90 °C for 60 min. The solution was allowed to cool,
2 mL of water was added to each tube and the FAMEs extracted
(hexane:chloroform, 4:1 v/v, 3  2 mL). The FAME extract was con-
centrated under nitrogen and transferred to GC/MS auto-sampler
vials for analysis.

2.9. 4,4-Dimethyloxazoline (DMOX) derivative preparation

The FAME solution was transferred into a reacti-vial (Pierce)
and dried under nitrogen. 2-Amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (500 lL,
Sigma–Aldrich) was added to the vial which was then ﬂushed with
nitrogen prior to heating for 18 h at 180 °C. The solution was al-
lowed to cool, water (2 mL) was added to each tube, the DMOX
derivatives were extracted (hexane:chloroform, 4:1 v/v, 3 
1 mL) and washed with water (2  2 mL). The DMOX derivatives
were concentrated under a stream of nitrogen and transferred to
auto-sampler vials for GC/MS analysis.

2.10. Trimethylsilyl (TMS) derivative preparation

The FAME solution was dried under nitrogen in an auto-sampler
vial. Pyridine (10 lL, Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland) and N-methyl-
N-(trimethylsilyl)triﬂuoroacetamide (MSTFA) containing 1% tri-
methylchlorosilane (TMCS) (10 lL, Supelco, Bellefonte, PA, USA)
were added to the sample and heated for 20 min at 60 °C. Hex-
ane:chloroform (10 lL, 4:1 v/v) was added to the FAME TMS
solution.

2.11. Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC/MS)

Samples were injected (0.2–1.0 lL injection volume) via an
auto-sampler onto a fused-silica capillary column (60 m 
0.25 mm i.d.) coated with a 70% cyanopropyl polysilphenylene-
siloxane bonded phase (SGE Pty Ltd., Melbourne; BPX70, thickness
0.25 lm) which was eluted with He (inlet pressure 15 psi) directly
into the ion source of a Thermo Polaris Q GC/MS (injection port
200 °C; interface 250 °C; source 200 °C). The column was tempera-
ture programmed from 60 °C (hold 1 min) to 120 °C at 30 °C min 1,
then to 140 °C at 5 °C min 1, then to 170 °C at 2 °C min 1, then to
200 °C at 1 °C min 1 and then to 250 °C at 10 °C min 1. The mass
spectrometer was operated in the electron ionisation (EI) mode
with ionisation energy of 70 eV. For chemical
ionisation (CI),
ammonia (2.0 mL min 1) and methane (1.7 mL min 1) reagent
gases were used.

Quantitative and qualitative analysis of FAME, DMOX and TMS
derivatives was performed with Xcalibur software (version 1.4,
Thermo Electron Corporation). GC separation was tested using a
standard 37 component FAME mixture (Supelco). Calibration
curves were generated and limits of detection (LoD) and quantiﬁ-
cation (LoQ) determined using palm oil (Fluka) and heptadecanoic
acid (Sigma–Aldrich). Gas chromatogram retention times and mass
spectral data were compared with FAME standards and a NIST-
Wiley library (Christie, 2003) (http://lipidlibrary.aocs.org/,
last
accessed 2 July, 2010).

2.12. Lipid body isolation

Lipid bodies were isolated from BAF-J5 cultures (375 mL)
(Jolivet et al., 2004) grown to stationary phase in TAP medium, pel-
leted and resuspended into 750 mL of TAP-N medium and incu-
bated for 3–4 days. The culture was harvested by centrifugation
(4000g for 5 min), washed with cold water (2) and resuspended
in buffer 1 (4 mL, 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5; 1 mM
EDTA; 10 mM KCl; 1 mM MgCl; 2 mM DTT and 0.6 M sucrose).
The cells were disrupted on ice using sonication (output setting
3; Ultrasonic processor W-385, Heat systems-Ultrasonics) for
2 min (10 s pulse with 15 s cooling on ice) and the homogenate
centrifuged (6000g at 4 °C for 20 min). The supernatant was over-
laid by one volume of buffer 2 (buffer 1 without 0.4 M sucrose) and
ultra-centrifuged (114,000g at 4 °C for 60 min). A thin layer of
surface-located lipid bodies was removed with forceps and deter-
gent-washed by resuspending in buffer 3 (6 mL, 10 mM sodium

phosphate buffer, pH 7.5; 1 mM EDTA; 10 mM KCl; 1 mM MgCl;
2 mM DTT; 0.2 M sucrose and 0.1% Tween 20). The suspension
was overlaid by one volume of 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer
(pH 7.5) and ultra-centrifuged as above. The lipid layer was again
removed with forceps and salt washed by resuspending in 6 mL
of buffer 1 containing 2 M NaCl. This suspension was overlaid by
one volume of 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer containing
0.25 M sucrose and 2 M NaCl and ultra-centrifuged as above. The
lipid body fraction and the lipid body layer was resuspended in
9 M urea (6 mL) and shaken (60 rpm, 10 min at room temperature).
The suspension was placed in a centrifuge tube, overlaid by one
volume of 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) and ultra-
centrifuged as above. The lipid body layer was collected,
resuspended in buffer 1 (6 mL), overlaid by one volume of buffer
2 and ultra-centrifuged as above. The ﬂoating lipid body fraction
was collected and resuspended in buffer 1 (100 lL).

2.13. Mass spectrometric identiﬁcation of proteins extracted from lipid
bodies

The lipid body fraction was extracted with four volumes of
diethyl ether (3), to remove the lipid from protein. Proteins that
potentially partition to the lipid-containing organic phase were
collected by evaporating the combined ether extracts and resus-
pending in 0.1% SDS and 0.1 M NaOH, preparatory to running on
a 4–12% Nu PAGE gel (Invitrogen). Proteins partitioning to the
aqueous phase (84 lL) were precipitated by the addition of TCA
to a ﬁnal concentration of 10%, or extracted by chloroform/metha-
nol (756 lL, 6:3, v/v). The TCA-precipitated proteins or the protein-
rich interface collected after chloroform/methanol extraction was
solubilised in 0.1 M NaOH containing 0.1% SDS. Proteins were sep-
arated on 4–12% Nu PAGE gels and stained with Fast Blue gel stain-
ing reagent. The stained protein bands were excised and digested
by trypsin (Djordjevic et al., 2007). The digested peptides were
analysed by MALDI-TOF-TOF ABI 4800 and subjected to MS and
MS/MS (Chen et al., 2009a,b; Kusumawati et al., 2008). The spectral
data was searched against the Chlamydomonas database, version
4.0 (Chlre v 4.0) downloaded from the DOE Joint Genome Initiative
(http://jgi.doe.gov) with the MASCOT-daemon 2.1.0 software using
the Australian Proteome Computational Facility (http://www.apc-
f.edu.au/mascot/cgi/).

2.14. Sequence databases

The C. reinhardtii v4.0 genome assembly and protein ﬁltered
model annotations were available through the Joint Genome Insti-
tute (JGI) Chlamydomonas site (http://genome.jgi-psf.org/Chlre4/
Chlre4.home.html). The non-redundant protein database was
available from the National Centre for Biotechnology Information
(NCBI) site (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).

2.15. Bioinformatic analysis of oleosins and caleosins

Previously identiﬁed oleosin and caleosin sequences from high-
er plants were used as the basis for detection of putative oleosins
and caleosins in C. reinhardtii. Each of these sequences was used
to seed a PSI-BLAST search against the NCBI non-redundant protein
database ‘nr’ (15 July 2009) and the predicted protein sequences
from the C. reinhardtii v4.0 genome assembly. Search parameters
were set to:  j 10,  e 10,  h 1e-5. Full-length amino acid se-
quences were extracted for all proteins producing high scoring seg-
ment pairs with E-values <10 for each of the PSI-BLAST searches.
These sets of proteins were then analysed using CLANS (Frickey
and Lupas, 2004) to identify false-positive and true positive hits
of protein sequences to the oleosin/caleosin family. Sequences that
did not group with known oleosins/caleosins were assumed to be

3346

G.O. James et al. / Bioresource Technology 102 (2011) 3343–3351

false-positive hits or highly derived members of the family and ex-
cluded from further analysis. This approach was used to identify
oleosin-like and caleosin-like sequences in the C. reinhardtii
genome.

3. Results and discussion

3.1. Growth characteristics

C. reinhardtii wild-type (cc-124 and cc-125) and starch mutant
strains (I7 and BAF-J5) showed typical growth recovery following
washing and subculturing in TAP medium (Fig. 1). When washed
and transferred into TAP-N medium, cell division was halted in
all strains (Fig. 1c), although absorbance continued to increase
(Fig. 1a and b) providing evidence of cell swelling. The absorbance
of the wild-type strains increased twofold after two days and then
plateaued. The starch mutant strains exhibited a twofold linear in-
crease in absorbance over the course of four days. The accumula-
tion of lipid bodies was examined when nitrogen starved (Fig. 2).
BAF-J5 cells increased in size and displayed abnormal cell mor-
phology over the course of the experiment when nitrogen limited,
as shown by confocal microscopy (Fig. 2d days 1–4 and Fig. 2h days
1–4). This was conﬁrmed by measurements of cell density (Fig. 1)
and by the relative decline of chlorophyll ﬂuorescence with respect
to absorbance (Fig. 3). Strains cc-125 and BAF-J5 did not show
visible accumulation of lipid bodies in TAP medium (Fig. 2e and g).
Lipid body production was clearly induced in TAP-N medium for
both cc-125 and BAF-J5 (Fig. 2f and g). BAF-J5 contained more and
larger lipid bodies compared to cc-125 under induction conditions.
Cell lysis of BAF-J5 was observed from day 5 with free lipid
bodies appearing in the media (unpublished results). This may be
due to a combination of increasing cell size (as noted above) and
induced weakness in the cell membranes from nitrogen starvation.
The cell autolysis observed in the cultures of the starch-less mu-
tant BAF-J5 may be advantageous for lipid extraction for biofuels
production.

3.2. Neutral lipid screening by Nile Red ﬂuorescence

The neutral lipid content was measured in vitro by the ﬂuores-
cence of Nile Red stained cells over the four day time-course exper-
iments under nitrogen sufﬁcient and deﬁcient treatments (Fig. 3)
(Chen et al., 2009a,b). Wild-type strains exhibited a relative 5-fold
increase in neutral lipid content over the course of four days. This
was quite modest when compared to strains I7 and BAF-J5 which
increased 13- and 16-fold over the same period, respectively
(Fig. 3a). When cell density was normalised to an absorbance of
Ab750 = 0.2 for comparative measures, cell density and the relative
chlorophyll content decreased for all strains (Fig. 3b). Nile Red ﬂuo-
rescence enabled neutral lipid storage in lipid bodies to be selec-
tively measured from the total lipid content of the cells. Nile Red
ﬂuorescence has previously been shown to be proportional to the
level of neutral lipid, cell density and the concentration of Nile
Red (Chen et al., 2009a,b). From a screening perspective, when cells
are increasing in size over time, normalisation of cell density based
upon absorbance will result in an underestimation relative neutral
lipid content. Also, there is a potential for differences in cell walls
to make comparisons between species problematic (Chen et al.,
2009a,b). However, it should be noted that the starch-less mutant
BAF-J5, has no cell wall, while the low starch mutant I7 does have a
cell wall. From the results it seems unlikely that the differences ob-
served Nile Red ﬂuorescence between the mutants and the wild-
types are due to the cell wall. Therefore, Nile Red based ﬂuores-
cence assays may be applied to C. reinhardtii for screening neutral
lipid and potentially to high-throughput platforms such as ﬂuores-

3.3. Lipid and carbohydrate screening by FTIR

The relative partitioning of carbon between lipid and carbohy-
drate was monitored by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy
(FTIR) (Fig. 4) as measured by changes in the spectral ratios of
lipid: amide I and carbohydrate: amide I (Fig. 4a, Supplementary
Table 1) (Dean et al., 2010; Murdock and Wetzel, 2009). The IR

and (b) chlorophyll content in wild-type (cc-124 and cc-125) and starch mutant (I7
and BAF-J5 strains under nitrogen starvation over four days.

results were then compared with those of two starch mutants, I7
with a mutation in the large regulatory subunit of AGPase and
BAF-J5 with a defective small catalytic subunit of AGPase. Both
starch mutants exhibited a small
increase in carbohydrate
(Fig. 4f) with I7 containing a higher relative content of carbohy-
drate compared to BAF-J5.

The mutation in BAF-J5 completely inhibits starch synthesis and
produces no detectable starch (Zabawinski et al., 2001). However,
the mutation in I7 does not completely inhibit starch synthesis
and still produces low levels of starch (less than 5% of the levels
in wild-type) (Ball et al., 1991). The increase in the carbohydrate
absorption band for I7 is most likely an accumulation of monosac-
charides and non-starch polysaccharides.

The lipid content increased for all strains over 4 days (Fig. 4e)
when nitrogen deprived. The lipid: amide I ratio increased 3-fold
for wild-type strains and a comparatively moderate increase of
4- and 5-fold occurred in the mutant strains for I7 and BAF-J5,
respectively (Fig. 4e). Two distinct correlations were found in the
relative lipid: amide I ratios between wild-type and starch mutant
strains when ﬂuorescence spectroscopy and mass spectrometry
data was compared with infrared spectroscopy data (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 1). Thus it is essential to determine the ﬂuorescence char-
acteristics of each strain before making comparisons between
strains. As with ﬂuorescence spectroscopy, screening lipid storage
by infrared spectroscopy requires characterisation of individual

spectrum (Fig. 4a) shows strong absorption for the carbohydrate
region (C–O–C) compared with weaker absorptions for the protein
amide I and amide II bands (C@O and N–H, respectively) and for
the lipid band (C@O). However, it should be noted that in drawing
correlations with intensity, the different IR bands have different
extinction coefﬁcients.

Carbon storage as lipid and carbohydrate was measured in all
strains after one day of nitrogen limitation. In the wild-type strains
(cc-124 and cc-125) which normally store excess carbon as starch,
substantial increases in the carbohydrate: amide I ratio was ob-
served (5- and 7-fold, respectively) after two days (Fig. 4f). These

3.4. Identiﬁcation and quantiﬁcation of fatty acids

The fatty acids of C. reinhardtii were comprehensively identiﬁed
and quantiﬁed by GC/MS following extractive methylation to fatty
acid methyl esters (FAMEs) (Lewis et al., 2000) (Table 1 and Fig. 5).
Quantiﬁcation was against a heptadecanoic acid (17:0) internal
standard. Fatty acids were identiﬁed from the FAME mass spectra

(electron, EI, and chemical ionisation, CI) and the positions of the
double bonds were determined from the EI mass spectra of the
dimethyloxazoline (DMOX) derivatives and by comparison to spec-
tra of authentic standards from the lipid library (Christie, 2003;
http://lipidlibrary.aocs.org/, last accessed 2 July, 2010). No hydrox-
ylated fatty acids were found from an analysis of trimethylsilyl
FAME derivatives.

Under nitrogen starvation, the starch-less mutant BAF-J5 was
found to contain up to 65% dcw fatty acids (Table 1). In nitrogen
sufﬁcient medium, the total fatty acid content was higher for the

starch mutant strains at 11% (I7) and 14% (BAF-J5) dcw than for
both wild-type strains at 9% dcw (Table 1). Under nitrogen starva-
tion, the total fatty acid of the wild-type strains increased 1.3- and
1.4-fold to 12% (cc-124) and 13% (cc-125), respectively. However,
the fatty acid content of the mutants increased 3.8-fold to 41%
(I7) and 4.7-fold to 65% (BAF-J5). In both mutant strains, the major
fatty acids were found to be 16:0, 18:1D9, 18:2 D9,12 and 18:3
D9,12,15. Complete separation for
the FAMEs of 20:0 and
18:4D5,9,12,15 was not achieved and levels were estimated as the
sum of the two components. Several essential fatty acids were

identiﬁed including the omega-3, a-linolenic acid (18:3D9,12,15),
omega-3, linoleic acid (18:2D9,12), and the omega-9 fatty acids,
oleic acid (18:1D9) and eicosenoic acid (20:1 D11). A range of
long-chain saturated and unsaturated fatty acids were identiﬁed
that have not previously been detected in C. reinhardtii, including;
20:0, 20:1D9, 20:2, 22:0, and 24:0. However, these long-chain fatty
acids were only detectable under nitrogen starvation and at levels
sufﬁcient for quantiﬁcation in the starch mutants. In the wild-type
strains these fatty acids were below the limit of quantiﬁcation
(LoQ) (Table 1). The presence of these essential and long-chain
fatty acids suggests the elongation and desaturation machinery
may be capable of synthesising long-chain polyunsaturated fatty
acids. It may be possible to engineer higher levels of these desir-
able long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (Singh et al., 2005).

unsaturated fatty acids changed markedly with proportionally
more monosaturated fatty acids being synthesis by the mutants
when deprived of nitrogen (
POLY increased from 0.2
to 0.9 and 0.7 for BAF-J5 and I7, respectively) (Table 1). Changes
in fatty acid composition in Chlamydomonas sp. has been previ-
ously reported in response to environmental changes including
temperature, pH, nitrogen and carbon dioxide (Poerschmann
et al., 2004; Sato, 1989; Sato et al., 1995; Tatsuzawa et al., 1996).
The short chain fatty acid identiﬁed were essentially consistent
with those previously reported in C. reinhardtii wild-types (Chi
et al., 2008; Kajikawa et al., 2006; Moellering and Benning,
2010). The following fatty acids were not identiﬁed: 16:1D3t or
16:3D4,7,10, 18:3D6,9,12 or 18:3D,5,12,15 as reported by Sato et al.
(1995). Two 16:3 FAMEs were detected but it was only possible
to conﬁrm the double bond position in 16:3D7,10,13 (Table 1).

Fig. 6. Enrichment of lipid body proteins from C. reinhardtii. SDS–PAGE gel images
of (lane 2) total algal protein compared to fractions enriched with lipid body
associating proteins, (lane 3) TCA precipitation and (lane 4) chloroform/methanol
extraction. Size markers occur in lane 1.

3.5. Lipid body-associated proteins

Lipid bodies were isolated from nitrogen starved BAF-J5 cells
and puriﬁed by sequential detergent, salt and urea washing. Lipid
was extracted into diethyl ether and SDS–PAGE analysis showed
that there was no protein present in the organic phase. The protein
in the remaining aqueous phase was recovered by either TCA pre-
cipitation or from the interface of a chloroform/methanol extrac-
tion. The isolated proteins were then run on SDS–PAGE (Fig. 6,
lanes 3 and 4, respectively). Protein bands were excised from the
gels and their identity determined using mass spectrometry
(Table 2).

The most abundant protein in each preparation was a 28 kDa
protein (Fig. 6, lane 3 band 3, and lane 4 band 5). Mass spectral
analysis showed this protein to be the major lipid droplet protein
(MLDP) as identiﬁed by Moellering and Benning (2010). Some pro-
teolytic degradation products of MLDP with lower molecular
masses were also identiﬁed (Fig. 6, Table 2). The remaining pro-
teins identiﬁed after enrichment appeared to be mitochondrial

ATP synthase, chlorophyll binding and light harvesting proteins
of the chloroplast. Therefore, these are likely to be low abundance
protein contaminants.

A sequence-similarity search of the C. reinhardtii genome identi-
ﬁed oleosin-like and caleosin-like genes (Table 3) and it is possible
that the protein products of these genes may be associated with li-
pid bodies. The atypical short length of the identiﬁed oleosin-like
gene may be due to a truncation of the predicted gene model; the
precise sequence will require experimental veriﬁcation. However,
no oleosin-like or caleosin-like proteins were found to be associated
with lipid bodies in the lipid body enriched fractions examined.

3.6. Induction of carbon storage by nitrogen deprivation

The Redﬁeld ratio in algae/phytoplankton is remarkably con-
stant over a range of species at C:N:P of 106:16:1 (Redﬁeld et al.,
1963). This appears to represent an optimal
incorporation of
macro-nutrients into the biosynthesis of cell constituents for
growth (Klausmeler et al., 2004). However, if nitrogen or phospho-
rus become scarce then carbon cannot be incorporated at the Red-
ﬁeld ratio for growth and carbon is stored as starch or lipid in
response to a high C:N cellular ratio. C. reinhardtii is a species that
normally prefers to store excess carbon as starch under nitrogen
limitation and is considered non-oleaginous, however, this and re-
cent studies (Li et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2009) indicate clearly that

if the storage of starch is blocked by mutation, then the cell can be
converted to a conditional oleaginous microalga.

4. Conclusions

C. reinhardtii starch mutants can accumulate fatty acids up to
65% of dry cell weight. The mutants produced signiﬁcant levels
of 16:0, 18:1D9, 18:2D9,12 and 18:3D9,12,15 and low levels of long-
chain fatty acids under nitrogen starvation. Long-chain fatty acid
yields may be increased selectively by using different environmen-
tal conditions or through genetic engineering. The presence of
oleosin-like and caleosin-like genes were detected in the C. rein-
hardtii genome. However, the MLDP was found to be the major pro-
tein in the lipid oil fraction and is consistent with this being a lipid
body associated protein in the starch mutant BAF-J5.
