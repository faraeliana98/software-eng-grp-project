Abstract: Langsat (Lansium domesticum var pubescens) and duku (Lansium Domesticum var.
domesticum) are very popular fruits in South East Asia.  Their sweet and sour taste make the
fruits are very popular among the people.  A research has been conducted to study the organic
acids  and  their  concentration  in  the  fruits  using  a  reversed  phase  liquid  chromatographic
technique.  Malic and citric acids are the main organic acids found in langsat and duku fruits.
Ascorbic and piroglutamic acids are present in low concentration.  The total organic acids in
langsat and duku fruits are 1.04 and 0.604 percent, respectively.  These concentrations are
agreed with the measured pH and total titratable acidity in both fruits.
Keywords: Langsat, duku, organic acids, reversed phase HPLC technique.

Introduction

Organic acids are chemicals consisting of carboxylic functional group with an alkyl group.  The organic
acids can be classified based on their alkyl group such as aliphatic, aromatic, or heterocyclic group, saturated
(saturated  and  unsaturated),  substituted  (substituted  and  unsubstituted)  and  the  number  of  carboxylic  group
(monocarboxylic, dicarboxylic, etc)1.

Organic acids present in living organisms as the products of metabolism.  The present of organic acids
in the fruits have been reported elsewhere because its roles in the taste and nutritional of the products.  Organic
acids  had  been  reported  in  tomatoes2,  manggo3,  peaches4,  various  oranges,  papaya  and  manggo5  and  apple
juice6.

Langsat (Lansium domesticum var pubescens) and duku (Lansium domesticum var. domesticum) fruits
are very popular in the South East Asian countries due to its taste, sweet and sour7.  The fruits are produced
mostly  once  a  year.    In  the  harvest  season,  the  fruits  are  sell  everywhere  from  at  the  side  roads  up  to  the
superstores.  The short living of the fruits freshness could be the reason why the fruits are not sold so far from
where they are produced.

So far the chemical properties of the fruits are not become the subjects of the scientific research yet.
There is no scientific report for the organic acids in these fruits to date.  Several reports show the maturity of the
fruits to the color appearance of the fruit skin8 and the volatile compounds of the fruit9.  Morton7 described a
general composition of langsat by quote a data  from India without any specific reference showed it contains
ascorbic acid (0.001 percent).  A total of sugar content in dokong (an intermediate strain between langsat and
duku) had been reported as 11 percent at the high maturity8.  The report has also included a total acid content of
the fruit based on a basic titration method as 0.74 percent.

Gomis and Alonso1 reviewed the organic acid analysis.  Organic acid analysis in foods and fruits are
done by various  methods  including titrimetric,  spectrometric,  enzymatic,  electrometric,  and chromatographic

methods.  Chromatographic methods over several advantages compared to the other methods including simple
sample preparation, and higher specificity and reliability.  Enzymatic method is very specific and need fewer
samples  clean  up  but  quite  expensive.    Among  the  chromatographic  methods,  high  performance  liquid
chromatography is the best for organic acid due to their fewer samples clean up, fast, sensitive and specific.
Ion-exchange, ion exclusion and reversed phase chromatographic methods have been developed for separation
and  determination  of  organic  acids.    Among  the  last  three  chromatographic  methods,  reversed  phase
chromatographic is the choice due to the system is a general purposes and this HPLC system is available in
many laboratories.

The  goal  of  this  work  is  to  determine  the  organic  acids  and  their  concentration  in  langsat  and  duku

fruits.

Experimental
Materials

The langsat and duku fruits  were purchased at the  local markets  in North Sulawesi, Indonesia.  The
standard  organic  acids  including  malic,  citric,  acetic,  lactic,  piroglutamic  and  fumaric  acids,  and potassium
phosphate and phosphoric acids were purchased from Sigma.

Sample preparation

The  langsat  and  duku  fruits  were separately peeled  and about  500  gram for  each  was  homogenized
using kitchen blender.  The juice was used directly for pH measurement, and diluted juice for total titratable
acidity.    For  high  performance  liquid  chromatographic  analysis,  the  juices  were  filtered  through  a  0.45 (cid:0)
Whatman filter paper with a vacuum pump.  The filtered samples were directly injected in to the HPLC system.

Sample analysis.

Acidity (pH).

The  pH  of  sample  was  determined  by  using  pH  meter  (Mettler  Toledo  320).    The  pH  meter  was
calibrated with standard buffers at pH 7.00 and 4.01.  The pH meter probe was directly deep into the sample
juice.

Total titratable acidity.

The total titratable acidity was  measured by the method described by Sadler and Murphy10 as follow.
Blended juice of 20 mL was diluted into distilled water up to 100 mL.  The diluted juice is titrated with 0.1 N
NaOH using phenolphthalein as indicator.  The acidity was calculated based on the malic acid concentration.
The acid concentration was calculated as following

       Normality of titrant x Volume of titrant x Equivalent weight of malic acid

% Acid =    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ X 100

Volume of sample x 1000

Chromatographic analysis

Samples  were analyzed  using  High  Performance  Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)  system,  Cecil  CE
4201  with  LC-  20AD  pump  and  UV  detector  SPD-20A  (Cecil  Instruments  Limited).    The  column  was  a
reversed phase column, Grace smart RP 18 5Âµ (150 x 4 mm).  The detector was set at 210 nm.  The injection
volume was 20 mL per injection.

The  mobile phase  was  a  50  mM  buffer  phosphate  made by  dilution  of  6.8  g potassium  dihydrogen
phosphate in 700 mL distilled water and added phosphoric acid until pH reached 2.8 then made up to 1000 mL
with water11.   The mobile phase was run at isocratic mode at flow rate of 0.7 mL per minute.

The  organic  acids  in  the samples  were  determination  following  the  retention  time  of  each  standard
organic acid, respectively. The concentration of organic acid was determined following the standard curve for
each organic acid12.

Results and Discussion
Acidity of the langsat and duku fruits

The acidity of the langsat and duku fruit measured as pH can be seen in Table 1.  The pH of the langsat
fruit is lower than the pH of the duku fruit, 3.85 and 4.56, respectively.  In other worlds, the acidity of langsat is
higher than the acidity of duku.  This is agreed with the taste of langsat is sourer than the taste of duku.

Total Titratable Acidity

The total titratable acidity of langsat  and  duku  fruit  can be seen  in Table 1.   Langsat  contains  about
twice  acid  than  duku.    The  total  acid  contents  in  langsat  and  duku  fruits  are  1.04  and  0.504  percent,
respectively.  These acid concentrations are about the same with those reported for the ripe dokong fruit (an
intermediate strain between langsat and duku) as 0.74 percent8.  The total titratable acidity is also agreed with
the pH of langsat and duku.  The pH of langsat is lower than the pH of duku.

Retention time of standard organic acids

The chromatographic system can separate the organic acid standards fairly well (Figure 1),  except for
the lactic and acetic acids have some overlap.  The retention time of standard organic acids can be seen in Table
2.  This retention time is slightly different with the previously analysis using different C18 column and HPLC
system13.  Although the sequence of these organic acids is the same with the previous study but the retention
times are much shorter ranging from 2.4 to 4.6 minutes than those retention times  of previous study ranging
from 5.1 to 9.6 minutes.

Organic Acids in Langsat and Duku

The profiles of the organic acids in langsat and duku are the same, containing malic, ascorbic, citric and
piroglutamic acids (Figure 2 and 3).  The acids can be separated quite well by the chromatographic system.
There  are  also  have  several  other  peaks  that  could  be  organic  acids  or  other  organic  compounds  are  not
identified yet.  There are need other organic acid standard to be tested or using other chromatographic methods
such as gas chromatography mass spectrometer (GC-MS) to determine these unidentified peaks.

The different  in both fruit  organic acids is the content  of these organic acids is  less  in the duku compared to
those in the langsat as can be seen on the size of those related peaks in Figure 2 and 3.

Figure 2.  Chromatogram of organic acids in langsat fruit.

Figure 3.  Chromatogram of the organic acids in duku fruit.

The organic acid content in langsat and duku fruits can be seen in Table 3. The major organic acids in
these fruits are malic and citric acids with the concentrations varying from 0.7 to 0.4 percent for langsat and
from 0.4 to 0.2 percent for duku.  The present of ascorbic acid is low, varying from 0.022 to 0.034 percent, and
the present of piroglutamic acid is very low varying from 0.002 to 0.003 percent.  The present of ascorbic acid
in the fruits is higher than that reported previously as 0.001 percent7.

The total  organic  acid content  in  langsat  is  higher  than in  duku,  1.1  and 0.6  percent,  respectively  or
almost half in duku than in langsat.  Both the major organic acid contents are higher in the langsat compared to
those in duku.  But the ascorbic acid content is higher in duku compared to that in langsat.  Higher organic acid
content in langsat than in duku is agreed with the total titratable acid and the pH of those fruits (Table 1).  The
taste of langsat fruit is also sourer compared to the taste of duku fruit.

Conclusion

Several  organic  acids  in  langsat  and  duku  fruits  are  found  including  malic,  citric,  ascorbic  and
piroglutamic acids.  The malic and citric acids are the main organic acids in both fruits with the concentration
(%)  of  0.691  and  0.391  for  langsat  and  0.386  and  0.180  for  duku,  respectively.    These  organic  acid
concentrations are agreed with the pH and total titratable acid in both fruits.  The pH of langsat is 3.85 and that
of duku is 4.56, while the total titratable acid for langsat is 1.04 and that for duku is 0.503 percent.
